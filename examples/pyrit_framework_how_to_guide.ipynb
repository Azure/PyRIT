    "# PyRIT Framework How to Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Intended for use by AI Red Teams, the Python Risk Identification Tool for generative AI (PyRIT) can help automate the process of identifying risks in AI systems.\n",
    "This guide will walk you through the process of using PyRIT for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting with AI Red Teaming, we recommend reading the following article from Microsoft: [\"Planning red teaming for large language models (LLMs) and their\n",
    "applications\"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/red-teaming).\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs introduce many categories of risk, which can be difficult to mitigate even with a red teaming plan in place. To quote the article above,\n",
    "\"with LLMs, both benign and adversarial usage can produce potentially harmful outputs, which can take many forms, including harmful content such as hate speech,\n",
    "incitement or glorification of violence, or sexual content.\" Additionally, a variety of security risks can be introduced by the deployment of an AI system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason, PyRIT is designed to help AI Red Teams scale their efforts. In this user guide, we describe two ways of using PyRIT:\n",
    "1. [Write prompts yourself](#write-prompts-yourself)\n",
    "2. [Generate prompts automatically with RedTeamingBot](#generate-prompts-automatically-with-redteamingbot)\n",
    "\n",
    "PyRIT also includes functionality to [score LLM ](#output-scoring) and keep track of conversation history with a built-in [memory](#memory) which we discuss below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Write prompts yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "The first way of using PyRIT is to write prompts yourself. These can be sent to any LLM endpoint with the classes from the [pyrit.chat](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT/tree/main/pyrit/chat) module (e.g., AzureOpenAIChat\n",
    "for Azure Open AI as below, HuggingFaceChat for Hugging Face, etc.) or by using other packages (e.g., the [openai](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) Python package)."

    "## Generate prompts automatically with `RedTeamingBot`\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can craft prompts to target specific harms manually, this can be a time-consuming process. Instead, PyRIT can also leverage a LLM to automatically generate\n",
    "prompts. In other words, in addition to the target LLM under assessment, PyRIT uses a second LLM to generate prompts that are then fed to the target LLM. We will refer to\n",
    "this second LLM as the `RedTeamingBot` in the upcoming code snippets. Importantly, this enables the red teamer to feed the target LLM’s responses back into the red teaming\n",
    "bot to generate multi-turn conversations. It is worth noting that when red teaming, the prompts sent to the target LLM can sometimes include content that gets moderated or\n",
    "blocked by the target LLM. This is often the intended behavior as this is precisely what prevents harmful content. However, when using an LLM to generate the prompts we\n",
    "need an endpoint with content moderation turned off, and ideally also with a model that has not been aligned using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).\n",
    "Otherwise, the ability to fully cover the risk surface may be severely limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RedTeamingBot` still needs to be configured to behave according to the red teamer's plan by using input parameters. `attack_strategy` is a prompt template that defines\n",
    "the attack strategy. The template can contain parameters that will be filled in by `attack_strategy_kwargs` as well as the mandatory `conversation_objective`."

    "\n",
    "The `MemoryInterface` is at the core of the system, it serves as a blueprint for custom storage solutions, accommodating various data storage needs, from JSON files to\n",
