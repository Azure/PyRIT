    "1. **Obtain the API Key:**\n",
    "   - Navigate to the AML Studio.\n",
    "   - Go to the 'Endpoints' section.\n",
    "   - Retrieve the API key and endpoint URI.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Set the Environment Variable:**\n",
    "   - Add the obtained API key to an environment variable named `AZURE_ML_API_KEY`.\n",
    "   - Add the obtained endpoint URI to an environment variable named `AZURE_ML_MANAGED_ENDPOINT`.\n",

I'm here to help you with any questions you have about marketing, branding, or demand generation.\\n\\nMarketing is the process of identifying, anticipating, and satisfying customer needs and wants through the creation, promotion, and distribution of products or services. This can include a wide range of activities, such as market research, product development, advertising, and public relations.\\n\\nBranding, on the other hand, is the process of creating a strong, positive perception of a company or product in the minds of consumers. This can be achieved through the use of a consistent visual identity (such as a logo or color scheme), messaging, and positioning.\\n\\nDemand generation is a marketing strategy that focuses on creating and nurturing interest in a product or service, with the goal of driving sales and revenue. This can involve a variety of tactics, such as content marketing, email marketing, and lead generation campaigns.\\n\\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any specific questions about these topics. I'm here to help.\"}"
