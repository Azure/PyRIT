# Multi-Turn orchestrators

<small>12 Dec 2024</small>

In PyRIT, orchestrators are typically thought of as the top-level component. It's really the space where you can implement your attack logic, and then notebooks should just be used to configure orchestratos.

However, over time, there have been some common patterns, and one is the multi-turn scenario.

## The problem

If you look at some of the code from release [0.4.0](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT/tree/releases/v0.4.0) in August, you may notice some weirdness.

Red teaming orchestrator, crescendo, TAP, and PAIR all do essentially the same thing in terms of setup - you configure your attack LLM, scorer, target, and you send prompts to achieve an objective. However, if you look at the code, there are differences.

In red teaming orchestrator, you had and attack_strategy instead of an objective (what even is an attack_strategy?).

PAIR had code that was `max_conversation_depth`

which was the same as Crescendo's `max_rounds` which was also passed as part of the `apply_crescendo_attack_async` method vs the `init` for PAIR. And also Crescendo returned a score, wheras the others mostly returned a conversation?

The code also has opportunities for re-use. Things like `print_conversation` (sometimes named `print`) did very similar things but required different implementations because of the different class structures.

There certainly were some efforts to standardize somewhat. The thing you were attacking was consistently called `prompt_target` and your attacker LLM was consistently called `red_teaming_chat`. However, these attacks were all written by different people, and for users it felt all over the place.

## Let's make it better

Can we standardize?

It turns out, yes, we can. `CrescendoOrchestrator`, `PairOrchestrator`, `RedTeamingOrchestrator`, `TreeOfAttacksWithPruningOrchestrator` are all now subclasses of `MultiTurnOrchestrator`. Here is what that means.

- `objective_target` is where we're ultimately sending the attack.
- `adversarial_chat` is our attacker controlled infrastructure to help generate prompts.
- `adversarial_chat_system_prompt_path` is the initial prompt to send to adversarial_chat.
- `max_turns` is the maximum number of turns for the conversation.
- `prompt_converters` are the prompt converters to use to convert the prompts before sending them to the prompt target.
- `objective_scorer` is the scorer used to see if the objective was achieved.
- `run_attack_async(objective: str, memory_labels: Optional[dict[str, str]] = None)` is the function to run the attack. It always returns a `MultiTurnAttackResult` which has information about the conversation and whether it achieved its objective.
- `run_attacks_async` will parallelize the attack.
- `print_conversation_async` is now standardized and will print the "best" conversation (if there is more than one).

We hope this makes it a lot easier to use. Our new documentation renamed the "Red Teaming Orchestrator" to "Multi Turn Orchestrator" and now you can think of these as swappable components. Most places you can use one, you can use another.

See the updated documentation [here](../code/orchestrators/2_multi_turn_orchestrators.ipynb).


## What's next?

At its core, orchestrators are meant to be top-level components and we want to keep that. However, there are certainly more opportunities to standardize. It's on our radar to standardize `PromptSendingOrchestrator` in a similar way. And we've opened a [few issues](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT/issues/585) for feature parity between MultiTurnOrchestrators.
