# Proxying PyRIT

<small>27 Jan 2025 - Bolor-Erdene Jagdagdorj</small>

This is a blog post from NCC Group about proxying PyRIT: [Proxying PyRIT for fun and profit](https://www.nccgroup.com/sg/research-blog/proxying-pyrit-for-fun-and-profit/). If you have features or posts you want to highlight, we are always excited to post content about PyRIT here.

The blog describes how to use proxies to intercept and analyze HTTP interactions with PyRIT and is a very exciting read!

Happy using PyRIT!
