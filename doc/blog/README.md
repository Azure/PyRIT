# Blog

Welcome to the PyRIT blog!

Unlike the documentation, we won't (always) try to keep this up to date. However, this is a good thing to check out if you want to see what's new! We'll try to point to the docs with all our biggest changes from here! So for example, if you've read through the documentation but want to keep up to date without re-reading everything, checking out the blog is a good way to go.

This is not meant to be polished, and community contributions to the blog are also welcome!
