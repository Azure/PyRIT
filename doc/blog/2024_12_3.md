# Multi-Turn orchestrators

<small>03 Dec 2024 - Rich Lundeen</small>

In PyRIT, orchestrators are typically seen as the top-level component. This is where your attack logic is implemented, while notebooks should primarily be used to configure orchestrators.

Over time, certain patterns have emergedâ€”one of the most common being the multi-turn scenario.

## The problem

If you look at some of the code from release [0.4.0](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT/tree/releases/v0.4.0) in August, you may notice some weirdness.

The Red Teaming Orchestrator, Crescendo, TAP, and PAIR all follow a similar setup: you configure your attack LLM, scorer, and target, then send prompts to achieve an objective. However, their implementation details vary.

In red teaming orchestrator, you had an `attack_strategy` instead of an `objective` (what even is an attack_strategy?).

PAIR had code that was `max_conversation_depth`

which was the same as Crescendo's `max_rounds` which was also passed as part of the `apply_crescendo_attack_async` method vs the `init` for PAIR. And also Crescendo returned a score, while the others mostly returned a conversation?

There were also missed opportunities for code reuse. For instance, functions like `print_conversation` (sometimes named `print`) performed almost identical tasks but required separate implementations due to differing class structures.

There _were_ some standardization efforts: the target being attacked was consistently named `prompt_target`, and the attacker LLM was always called `red_teaming_chat`. However, because these attacks were implemented by different contributors, the overall experience felt fragmented for users.

## Let's make it better

Can we standardize?

It turns out, yes, we can. `CrescendoOrchestrator`, `PairOrchestrator`, `RedTeamingOrchestrator`, `TreeOfAttacksWithPruningOrchestrator` are all now subclasses of `MultiTurnOrchestrator`. Here is what that means.

- `objective_target` refers to the entity receiving the attack.
- `adversarial_chat` represents the attacker-controlled infrastructure used to generate prompts.
- `adversarial_chat_system_prompt_path` specifies the system prompt defined for adversarial_chat.
- `max_turns` defines the maximum number of conversation turns.
- `prompt_converters` are used to modify prompts before sending them to the target.
- `objective_scorer` evaluates whether the objective was achieved.
- `run_attack_async(objective: str, memory_labels: Optional[dict[str, str]] = None)` executes the attack and always returns a `OrchestratorResult`, which includes information about the conversation and the outcome.
- `run_attacks_async` enables parallelized attacks.
- `print_conversation_async` is now standardized and prints the "best" conversation (when multiple exist).

We hope these changes make orchestrators significantly easier to use. With the updated documentation, the "Red Teaming Orchestrator" has been renamed "Multi-Turn Orchestrator," emphasizing that these components are now swappable. In most scenarios, you can substitute one orchestrator for another.

See the updated documentation [here](../code/orchestrators/2_multi_turn_orchestrators.ipynb).


## What's next?

Orchestrators are, at their core, meant to remain top-level components. While we've made strides in standardization, there's still room for improvement. For instance, we're planning to standardize the `PromptSendingOrchestrator` in a similar way (including updating its naming for consistency). And we've opened a [few issues](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT/issues/585) for feature parity between MultiTurnOrchestrators.
