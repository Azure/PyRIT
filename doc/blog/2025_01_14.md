# Using PyRIT as a Bug Hunter

<small>14 Jan 2025 - Rich Lundeen</small>

In early December, Martin, Ram, and I had the opportunity to give a talk about [Zero Day Quest](https://aka.ms/aibounty). It was a great experience to share a bounty-hunder perspective on using PyRIT.

The talk covered:

- An introduction to the AI Bug Bounty and the types of bugs Microsoft is rewarding.
- A detailed example of one such bug.
- An overview of PyRIT and its capabilities.
- A demonstration of how PyRIT can be used to uncover these types of bugs.

Happy bug hunting!
