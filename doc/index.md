# PyRIT

Welcome to the Python Risk Identification Tool for generative AI (PyRIT)! PyRIT is designed to be a flexible and extensible tool that can be used to assess the security and safety issues of generative AI systems in a variety of ways.

Before starting with AI Red Teaming, we recommend reading the following article from Microsoft:
["Planning red teaming for large language models (LLMs) and their applications"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/red-teaming).

Generative AI systems introduce many categories of risk, which can be difficult to mitigate even with a red teaming
plan in place. To quote the article above, "with LLMs, both benign and adversarial usage can produce
potentially harmful outputs, which can take many forms, including harmful content such as hate speech,
incitement or glorification of violence, or sexual content." Additionally, a variety of security risks
can be introduced by the deployment of an AI system.

## Installation Guide

PyRIT offers flexible installation options to suit different needs. Choose the path that best fits your use case:

```{important}
**Version Compatibility:**
- **User installations** (Docker, Pip/Conda) install the **latest stable release** from PyPI
- **Contributor installations** (DevContainers, Local Development) use the **latest development code** from the `main` branch
- Always match your notebooks to your PyRIT version - download from the corresponding release branch if using a stable release
```

## Recommended Docs Reading Order

There is no single way to read the documentation, and it's perfectly fine to jump around. However, here is a recommended reading order. Note that in many sections there are numbered documentation pages. If there is no number attached, it is supplemental and the recommended reading order would be to skip it on a first pass.
