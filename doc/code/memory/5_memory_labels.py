# # 5. Resending Prompts Using Memory Labels Example
#
# Memory labels are a free-from dictionary for tagging prompts for easier querying and scoring later on. The `GLOBAL_MEMORY_LABELS`
# environment variable can be set to apply labels (e.g. `username` and `op_name`) to all prompts sent by any orchestrator. You can also
# pass additional memory labels to `run_attacks_async` in the `PromptSendingOrchestrator` or `run_attack_async` for all `MultiTurnOrchestrators`.
# Passed-in labels will be combined with `GLOBAL_MEMORY_LABELS` into one dictionary. In the case of collisions,
# the passed-in labels take precedence.
#
# You can then query the database (either AzureSQL or DuckDB) for prompts with specific labels, such as `username` and/or `op_name`
# (which are standard), as well as any others you'd like, including `harm_category`, `language`, `technique`, etc.
#
# We take the following steps in this example:
# 1. Send prompts to a text target using `PromptSendingOrchestrator`, passing in `memory_labels` to `run_attacks_async`.
# 2. Retrieve these prompts by querying for the corresponding memory label(s).
# 3. Resend the retrieved prompts.
#
# Note that similar steps can be taken with `MultiTurnOrchestrators` as well by passing in `memory_labels` to `run_attack_async`.

# Because you have labeled `group1`, you can retrieve these prompts later. For example, you could score them as shown [here](../orchestrators/4_scoring_orchestrator.ipynb). Or you could resend them as shown below; this script will resend any prompts with the label regardless of modality.
