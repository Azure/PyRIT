# # 7. PromptSendingAttack with Azure SQL Memory
#
# This demo is about when you have a list of prompts you want to try against a target. All interactions with the target will be saved in Azure SQL Memory. It includes the ways you can send the prompts,
# how you can modify the prompts, and how you can view results. Before starting, import the necessary libraries.
#
# ## Prerequisites
#  - Before you begin, ensure you are setup with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).
#  - In addition, ensure that you have proper access to the Azure SQL resource by running this [6_azure_sql_memory.ipynb](./6_azure_sql_memory.ipynb).
#
# The first example is as simple as it gets.

# # Automatic Scoring with Azure SQL Memory

# The `PromptSendingAttack` also has built-in support to score prompt responses in parallel. All interactions with the target and scorers will be saved in Azure SQL Memory.
# This example shows how to pass in a list of scorers to the attack.

# # Red Teaming Orchestrator with Multi-Modal and Multi-Turn with Azure SQL Memory
#
# You can utilize Azure SQL Memory to persist all interactions in multi-turn attack strategies or multi-modal scenarios simply by passing the Azure SQL Memory instance to the orchestrator.
#
# In this example, we'll try to convince an image generation model to generate a harmful image.
#
# Notably, scoring happens with an Azure OpenAI GPT-V model that can process our scoring instructions
# plus image and generate a score based on the image content.
# The score is then used as feedback to the red teaming LLM to generate new prompts.
# Similarly, if the image generation prompt gets blocked by content filters we use that as
# feedback to the red teaming LLM.
# This process will continue until the objective is achieved (i.e., a harmful image is generated)
# or a maximum number of attempts is reached.
#
# > **Note:** Multi-modal content generated from the target, such as images, will be stored in the Azure Blob Storage Account's result container specified by the provided environment variable. Additionally, all interactions with the target and scorers will be saved in Azure SQL Memory
