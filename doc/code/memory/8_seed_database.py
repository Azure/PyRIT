# # 8. Seed Prompt Database
#
# Apart from storing results in memory it's also useful to store datasets of seed prompts
# and seed prompt templates that we may want to use at a later point.
# This can help us in curating prompts with custom metadata like harm categories.
# As with all memory, we can use local DuckDBMemory or AzureSQLMemory in Azure to get the
# benefits of sharing with other users and persisting data.

# ## Retrieving prompts from the database
#
# First, let's get an idea of what datasets are represented in the database.

# %%
memory.get_seed_dataset_names()

# %% [markdown]
# The dataset we just uploaded (called "2025_06_pyrit_illegal_multimodal_example") is also represented.
# To get all seed prompts from that dataset, we can query as follows:

# %%
dataset_name = "2025_06_pyrit_illegal_multimodal_example"
prompts = memory.get_seeds(dataset_name=dataset_name)
print(f"Total number of the prompts with dataset name '{dataset_name}':", len(prompts))
for prompt in prompts:
    print(prompt.__dict__)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Adding multimodal Seed Groups to the database
# In this next example, we will add a Seed Group with prompts across the audio, image, video, and text modalities.
# Seed Prompts that have the same `prompt_group_alias` will be part of the same Seed Group. Within a Seed Group,
# Seed Prompts that share a `sequence` will be sent together as part of the same turn (e.g. text and corresponding image).
# <br> <center> <img src="../../../assets/seed_prompt.png" alt="seed_prompt.png" height="600" /> </center> </br>
# When we add non-text seed prompts to memory, encoding data will automatically populate in the seed prompt's
# `metadata` field, including `format` (i.e. png, mp4, wav, etc.) as well as additional metadata for audio
# and video files, including `bitrate` (kBits/s as int), `samplerate` (samples/second as int), `bitdepth` (as int),
# `filesize` (bytes as int), and `duration` (seconds as int) if the file type is supported by TinyTag.
# Example supported file types include: MP3, MP4, M4A, and WAV. These may be helpful to filter for as some targets
# have specific input prompt requirements.

# ## Setting an objective via seed prompts
# Many times, we want to associate a specific objective with a seed prompt or seed group.
# This can be done by setting the `is_objective` field to true in the seed prompt YAML definition.
# In this example, we have set the `is_objective` field to true for one of the seed prompts in
# "2025_06_pyrit_illegal_multimodal_example." By default, seed prompts are not objectives

# upon initialization. This will set the objective accordingly. Note that there can only be one objective per SeedGroup.
