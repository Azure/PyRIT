# PromptRequestPiece and PromptRequestResposne

One of the most basic data structures is [PromptRequestPiece](../../../pyrit/models/prompt_request_piece.py) and [PromptRequestResponse](../../../pyrit/models/prompt_request_response.py).

`PromptRequestPiece` is a single piece of a request to a target. It has a `role` (e.g. user), a `type` (like text or image_path), a `value` (like "hello, how are you"), and various other fields. This is a unit that is stored in the database.

`PromptRequestResponse` can be thought of as a single request or response to a target. It can contain multiple `PromptRequestPieces`. E.g. if you send an image with text in a single request, one `PromptRequestResponse` is made up of two `PromptRequestPieces`.

This is plumbed all the way through PyRIT, and the flexibility allows us to interact with various modalities seemlessly.
