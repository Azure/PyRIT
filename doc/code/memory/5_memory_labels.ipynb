    "# 5. Resending Prompts Using Memory Labels Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory labels are a free-from dictionary for tagging prompts for easier querying and scoring later on. The `GLOBAL_MEMORY_LABELS`\n",
    "environment variable can be set to apply labels (e.g. `username` and `op_name`) to all prompts sent by any orchestrator. You can also\n",
    "pass additional memory labels to `run_attacks_async` in the `PromptSendingOrchestrator` or `run_attack_async` for all `MultiTurnOrchestrators`.\n",
    "Passed-in labels will be combined with `GLOBAL_MEMORY_LABELS` into one dictionary. In the case of collisions,\n",
    "the passed-in labels take precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then query the database (either AzureSQL or DuckDB) for prompts with specific labels, such as `username` and/or `op_name`\n",
    "(which are standard), as well as any others you'd like, including `harm_category`, `language`, `technique`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the following steps in this example:\n",
    "1. Send prompts to a text target using `PromptSendingOrchestrator`, passing in `memory_labels` to `run_attacks_async`.\n",
    "2. Retrieve these prompts by querying for the corresponding memory label(s).\n",
    "3. Resend the retrieved prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that similar steps can be taken with `MultiTurnOrchestrators` as well by passing in `memory_labels` to `run_attack_async`."
