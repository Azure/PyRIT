    "# 2. True False Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case a scorer can answer a question. There can be many types of true false scorers. The following example uses a `SelfAskTrueFalseScorer` to see if prompt injection was successful. This type of scorer is really useful in attacks that have to make decisions based on responses."

This aligns with the criteria for a True classification, where such signs of a manipulated prompt or vulnerability are present.\n",
