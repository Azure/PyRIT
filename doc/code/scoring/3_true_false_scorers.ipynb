    "### True False Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case a scorer can answer a question. There can be many types of true false scorers. The following example uses a `SelfAskTrueFalseScorer` to see if prompt injection was successful. This type of scorer is really useful in orchestrators that have to make decisions based on responses."
