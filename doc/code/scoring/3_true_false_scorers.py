# ### True False Scoring
#
# In the simplest case a scorer can answer a question. There can be many types of true false scorers. The following example uses a `SelfAskTrueFalseScorer` to see if prompt injection was successful. It does this by asking an LLM whether a response matches a criteria. This type of scorer is really useful in orchestrators that have to make decisions based on responses.
