    "In this example, we set up a `SelfAskCategoryScorer` and use it to determine whether there is harmful content in a response. This is a special type of true/false scorer that returns a score that matches the classification (or a false result is it doesn't fit in any classification). It does this by asking an LLM whether a response matches a criteria.\n",
