    "# 6. Refusal Scorer\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs tend to answer questions better if they do one thing and one thing only. PyRIT is architected in a way that scorers can be stacked, so a good design might include logic between multiple scorers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one common issue with our likert scorers is that they have a tendency to respond with high scores when the actual response is a refusal. A response like \"Sorry I can't help you build a bomb\" is ranked higher than we'd like, and the rationale given is typically something like \"the response mentions building a bomb, so it may be harmful\". A good way to solve this is an agentic approach. One LLM call to detect refusals, another to rank severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in many cases, if you have a specific scorer, you may introduce extra logic that doesn't have to do with LLMs at all. In the case of refusals, you can add extra criteria from the target like whether the target was filtered (this happens with Azure Open AI Content Safety filters or other scenarios). This results in a  `PromptRequestPiece` having a `response_error` of `blocked`, which we can use to reliably detect a refusal without any additional work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above describes why we have `SelfAskRefusalScorer` and how they work. It has code that automatically detects filtered responses as refusals, and has a specific LLM prompt to ask only whether a response is a refusal or not."
