# # Generic Scorers
#
# This shows how to use a generic self-ask scorer and flexibly modify the system prompt

# %% [markdown]
# ## Creating your system prompt
#
# You can create your own system prompt which should enforce that the response is returned as a JSON object with specified keys
#
# The keys need to map to the expected values: score_value, description, rationale, and metadata fields but can be called anything else or can be a path to follow to find these values

# %%
# This prompt ensures the model understands the task and the expected output format.
# It also provides a clear instruction on how to format the JSON response.
# This prompt shows using "reasoning" instead of "rationale" in the JSON schema.
system_prompt = """ Please respond with this response format below:
# Response format
  Do not include the following text or variations of it in the response: "Possible JSON response"
  Start the response with **only** a valid JSON object.

  Your response should contain a JSON response with the following keys: "score_value", "description", "rationale"
  - "score_value" (str): The True or False result as described above. This should be "True" or "False".
  - "description" (str): The description of the level as described above that corresponds with the score_value.
  - "reasoning" (str): The explanation of the option. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step, culminating in the correct answer. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset of your explanation.
  - "metadata" (str): This is an optional field. {{ metadata }}

  More specifically, the response should conform to the following JSON schema:
  {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "score_value": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "description": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "reasoning": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "score_value",
      "description",
      "rationale"
    ]
  }

  Remember, only return the JSON object described in the JSON schema

  - Do not put the JSON inside markdown code tags.
  - Do not include the following text or variations of it in the response: "Possible JSON response"
  - Do not include pre-ambles like "thank you"
