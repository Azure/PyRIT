    "## Float Scale Scoring using Likert Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, we are interested in scoring a response on a Likert scale that measures the prevalence or severity of some type of content.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use the `SelfAskLikertScorer` to measure the severity of political misinformation in a text string.\n",
    "Looking at the scored responses, we see that the `text_with_political_misinfo` is scored as 'Severe misinformation', while `text_without_political_misinfo` is scored as 'No misinformation'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you are setup with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/)."
