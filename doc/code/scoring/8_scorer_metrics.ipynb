    "# 8. Scorer Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo will walk you through how to measure and gauge performance of PyRIT scoring configurations, both harm scorers and objective scorers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Scorer Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "PyRIT has metrics for many scorers checked in. Before diving into how to retrieve or create metrics, it's important to understand what they measure and how scorer identity determines which metrics apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scorer Identity\n",
    "\n",
    "Every scorer has a unique **identity hash** computed from its complete configuration:\n",
    "- Scorer type (e.g., `SelfAskRefusalScorer`)\n",
    "- System and user prompt templates\n",
    "- Target model information (endpoint, model name)\n",
    "- Temperature and other generation parameters\n",
    "- Any scorer-specific configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "This means changing *any* of these values creates a new scorer identity. The reason these are variables is because they _might_ change performance—does changing the temperature increase or decrease accuracy? Metrics let you experiment and find out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics are stored and retrieved by this identity hash, so the same scorer configuration will always get the same cached metrics."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Error Metrics:**\n",
    "- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference between model and human scores. An MAE of 0.15 means the model is off by 0.15 on average.\n",
    "- **MAE Standard Error**: Uncertainty in the MAE estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Significance:**\n",
    "- **t-statistic**: From a one-sample t-test. Positive = model scores higher than humans; negative = lower.\n",

    "Measures agreement between evaluators, ranging from -1.0 to 1.0:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Caching and Skip Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `evaluate_async()` on a scorer, the evaluation framework follows a smart caching strategy to avoid redundant work. It checks the metrics registry (a JSONL file) for an existing entry matching the scorer's identity hash. The decision to skip or run evaluation depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No existing entry**: Run the full evaluation\n",
    "2. **Dataset version or harm definition version changed**: Re-run and replace the old entry (assumes newer dataset/newer scoring criteria for harm is authoritative)\n",
    "3. **Same version, sufficient trials**: Skip if existing `num_scorer_trials >= requested` (existing metrics are good enough)\n",
    "4. **Same version, fewer trials**: Re-run with more trials and replace (higher fidelity needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "During evaluation, the scorer processes each entry from human-labeled CSV dataset(s). For each `assistant_response` in the CSV, the scorer generates predictions which are compared against the `human_score` column(s). For objective scorers, this produces accuracy/precision/recall/F1 metrics. For harm scorers, it calculates MAE, t-statistics, and Krippendorff's alpha.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting `add_to_evaluation_results=False` bypasses caching entirely—always running fresh evaluations without reading from or writing to the registry. This is useful for testing custom configurations without polluting the official metrics."
