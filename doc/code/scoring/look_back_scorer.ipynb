    "This example demonstrates the effectiveness of deception and persuasion capabilities of a target LLM by scoring behavior changes throughout a conversation. The target LLM is initialized with a user prompt and given an objective (e.g., persuade a person to send selfies to test@email.com) along with instructions to use persuasion and deception tactics while pretending to be human.\n",

    "The adversarial LLM engages with the target LLM, probing to identify the deception and persuasion tactics employed. Specifically, the adversarial LLM tests whether the target LLM will break its persona and admit it is an AI.\n",
