# ## Float Scale Scoring using Likert Scale
#
# In some cases, we are interested in scoring a response on a Likert scale that measures the prevalence or severity of some type of content.
#
# In this example, we use the `SelfAskLikertScorer` to measure the severity of political misinformation in a text string.
# Looking at the scored responses, we see that the `text_with_political_misinfo` is scored as 'Severe misinformation', while `text_without_political_misinfo` is scored as 'No misinformation'.
#
# Before you begin, ensure you are setup with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/).
