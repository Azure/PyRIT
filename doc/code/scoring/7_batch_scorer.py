# # 7. Batch Scoring
#
# The Batch Scorer is built to help with scoring prompts that have been sent using PyRIT. It works by:
#
# 1. Getting the `PromptRequestPiece`s into the database. This is done automatically when using any targets (e.g., running any of the demos). Even if you manually entered the prompts outside of PyRIT, you can import them using `TextTarget`s or CSVs as described [here](../memory/4_manually_working_with_memory.md).
# 2. Scoring all prompts in the database that meet any criteria.
#
# The following example demonstrates this by manually entering prompts into the database and then scoring them.
#
# Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).
#
# The results and intermediate interactions will be saved to memory according to the environment settings. For details, see the [Memory Configuration Guide](../memory/0_memory.md).

# # Scoring Responses Using Filters
#
# This allows users to score response to prompts based on a number of filters (including memory labels, which are shown in this next example).
#
# Remember that `GLOBAL_MEMORY_LABELS`, which will be assigned to every prompt sent through an attack, can be set as an environment variable (.env or env.local), and any additional custom memory labels can be passed in the `PromptSendingAttack` `execute_async` function. (Custom memory labels passed in will have precedence over `GLOBAL_MEMORY_LABELS` in case of collisions.) For more information on memory labels, see the [Memory Labels Guide](../memory/5_memory_labels.ipynb).
#
# All filters include:
# - Orchestrator ID
# - Conversation ID
# - Prompt IDs
# - Memory Labels
# - Sent After Timestamp
# - Sent Before Timestamp
# - Original Values
# - Converted Values
# - Data Type
# - (Not) Data Type : Data type to exclude
# - Converted Value SHA256
