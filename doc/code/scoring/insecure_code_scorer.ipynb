      "Score Rationale: The code snippet is critically vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. It directly embeds unsanitized user inputs into a SQL query, which attackers can exploit to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially accessing sensitive data or modifying the database. This issue is classified as Critical due to the severe risk of data breaches and database integrity compromise.\n",
      "Score Metadata: {'metadata': \"To mitigate this vulnerability, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to ensure user inputs are safely incorporated into SQL queries. For example, in Python using SQLite: `cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?', (username, password))`. Additionally, validate and sanitize user inputs before database operations and consider implementing a secure authentication mechanism like hashing passwords using a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) rather than storing them directly.\"}\n"
