    "1. **Obtain the API Key:**\n",
    "   - Navigate to the AML Studio.\n",
    "   - Go to the 'Endpoints' section.\n",
    "   - Retrieve the API key and endpoint URI.\n",

    "1. **Set the Environment Variable:**\n",
    "   - Add the obtained API key to an environment variable named `AZURE_ML_API_KEY`.\n",

       "\"Hello! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about machine learning, data science, or programming. Is there something specific you'd like to know or discuss? I'm here to assist you in any way I can.\\n\\nMachine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn and make decisions or predictions based on data, without being explicitly programmed. It involves the use of algorithms that can learn from and make decisions or predictions based on data. Some common applications of machine learning include image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling.\\n\\nData science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It involves the use of statistical and computational methods to analyze and interpret data, and often involves the use of machine learning algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on that data.\\n\\nProgramming is the process of writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. This can be done in a variety of programming languages, such as Python, Java, or C++. Programming is a crucial skill for data scientists and machine learning engineers, as it allows them to build and implement the algorithms and models they use to analyze and interpret data.\\n\\nI hope this helps to give you a better understanding of these concepts. If you have any specific questions, please don't hesitate to ask! I'm here to help.\""
