    "# Default Values\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call initialize_pyrit, you can pass it initialization_scripts and/or initializers. These can do anything, including setting convenience variables. But one of the primary purposes is to set default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed information about the PyRIT initialization system, including PyRITInitializer classes and execution order, see the [PyRIT Initialization System](pyrit_initialization.ipynb) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is this important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have an `OpenAIChatTarget`. What is the default?\n",
    "\n",
    "It really depends. An `OpenAIChatTarget` may be gpt-5, but it also might be llama. And these targets might take different parameters. Additionally, what is it being used for? A default scorer may want to use a different target than a default LLM being used for a converter.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be a pain to set these every time. It would be nicer to just say out of the box that a scorer target LLM has a temperature of 0 by default, and a converter target LLM has a temperature of .7 by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Default Values Work\n",
    "\n",
    "When an initializer calls `set_default_value`, it registers a default value for a specific class and parameter combination. These defaults are stored in a global registry and are automatically applied when classes are instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important things to understand is that **explicitly provided values always override defaults**. Defaults only apply when:\n",
    "1. A parameter is not provided at all, OR\n",
    "2. A parameter is explicitly set to `None`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pass a value (even `0`, `False`, or `\"\"`), that value will be used instead of the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using `apply_defaults` Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it's good to be selective over which classes can use this. It is very powerful but can also make debugging more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes that want to participate in the default value system use the `@apply_defaults` decorator on their `__init__` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pyrit.common.apply_defaults import apply_defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyConverter(PromptConverter):\n",
    "    @apply_defaults\n",
    "    def __init__(self, *, converter_target: Optional[PromptChatTarget] = None, temperature: Optional[float] = None):\n",
    "        self.converter_target = converter_target\n",
    "        self.temperature = temperature\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Uses defaults for both parameters (if configured)\n",
    "converter1 = MyConverter()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Uses provided value for converter_target, default for temperature\n",
    "converter2 = MyConverter(converter_target=my_target)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Uses provided values for both (defaults ignored)\n",
    "converter3 = MyConverter(converter_target=my_target, temperature=0.8)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Defaults can be set on parent classes and will apply to subclasses (unless `include_subclasses=False` is specified).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "PyRIT supports two complementary approaches for initialization, which is where default values can be initialized:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Initializers (Stable & Tested)\n",
    "\n",
    "PyRIT includes built-in initializer classes that provide well-tested, documented configurations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SimpleInitializer**: Basic OpenAI configuration with minimal requirements\n",
    "- **AIRTInitializer**: Full AIRT configuration using Azure OpenAI setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use these classes directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pyrit.setup.initializers import SimpleInitializer, AIRTInitializer\n",
    "\n",
    "initialize_pyrit(memory_db_type=\"InMemory\", initializers=[SimpleInitializer()])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### External Initialization Scripts (Flexible & Extensible)\n",
    "\n",
    "For custom configurations, rapid prototyping, or user-specific needs, you can create external PyRITInitializer classes in separate files. This is especially powerful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You need a custom target configuration for a specific project\n",
    "- You're experimenting with new configurations before integrating them\n",
    "- You have PyRIT checked out and want to add custom configurations without modifying the core library\n",
    "- You need to share configurations across different projects\n",
    "\n",
