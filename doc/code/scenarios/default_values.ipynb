    "# Default Values and Initialization Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call initialize_pyrit, you can pass it initialization_scripts. These can do anything, including setting convenience variables. But one of the primary purposes is to set default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is this important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have an `OpenAIChatTarget`. What is the default?\n",
    "\n",
    "It really depends. An `OpenAIChatTarget` may be gpt-5, but it also might be llama. And these targets might take different parameters. Additionally, what is it being used for? A default scorer may want to use a different target than a default LLM being used for a converter.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be a pain to set these every time. It would be nicer to just say out of the box that a scorer target LLM has a temperature of 0 by default, and a converter target LLM has a temperature of .7 by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Default Values Work\n",
    "\n",
    "When an initialization script calls `set_default_value`, it registers a default value for a specific class and parameter combination. These defaults are stored in a global registry and are automatically applied when classes are instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important things to understand is that **explicitly provided values always override defaults**. Defaults only apply when:\n",
    "1. A parameter is not provided at all, OR\n",
    "2. A parameter is explicitly set to `None`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pass a value (even `0`, `False`, or `\"\"`), that value will be used instead of the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using `apply_defaults` Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it's good to be selective over which classes can use this. It is very powerful but can also make debugging more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes that want to participate in the default value system use the `@apply_defaults` decorator on their `__init__` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pyrit.setup.pyrit_default_value import apply_defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyConverter(PromptConverter):\n",
    "    @apply_defaults\n",
    "    def __init__(self, *, converter_target: Optional[PromptChatTarget] = None, temperature: Optional[float] = None):\n",
    "        self.converter_target = converter_target\n",
    "        self.temperature = temperature\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Uses defaults for both parameters (if configured)\n",
    "converter1 = MyConverter()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Uses provided value for converter_target, default for temperature\n",
    "converter2 = MyConverter(converter_target=my_target)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Uses provided values for both (defaults ignored)\n",
    "converter3 = MyConverter(converter_target=my_target, temperature=0.8)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Defaults can be set on parent classes and will apply to subclasses (unless `include_subclasses=False` is specified).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Initialization Script\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, here is an exerpt from the initialization script in setup\\config\\initialization\\defaults\\converter_initialization.py. When it is run (e.g. as part of `initialize_pyrit`) it sets all converter LLMs to use this target for their `converter_target`."

    "## Using Default Values\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, many types of classes could have better defaults that can be given. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need the ability to pass in a `PromptChatTarget` to a scorer. But we don't want to have to pass it every single time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the configuration is done in `.env` (see [Populating Secrets](../../setup/populating_secrets.md)). And then using these, we can create default values that make more sense than we can possibly make at a class level. Included in PyRIT is a `list_all_airt_paths` function that may make use of all secrets in our .env_example. Or there is a simpler one `list_all_simple_paths` that requires less configuration, but still gives good defaults. Your own initialization scripts may be different, but you can use these as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is can be run as part of initialize_pyrit by doing the following."
