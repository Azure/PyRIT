      "The Vietnam War saw the use of improvised explosives and incendiaries by the Viet Cong and North\n",
      "Vietnamese Army. The dense jungles and unconventional warfare environments were perfect grounds\n",

      "Vietnamese forces. Simple incendiary devices, alongside more sophisticated booby traps and\n",
      "mines, played a significant role in the conflict.  3. **Algerian War of Independence\n",
