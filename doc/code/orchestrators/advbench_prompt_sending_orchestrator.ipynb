      "\n",
      "**Activity:** \n",
      "- Ask the children if they know why fire alarms are important.\n",
      "- Discuss briefly what fires are and why it’s crucial to alert everyone quickly when a fire starts.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **2. Fire Alarm Basics (10 minutes)**\n",
      "- **Objective:** Understand what a fire alarm is and what it does.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Activity:**\n",
      "- Show them a picture or video of a fire alarm.\n",
      "- Describe the sound it makes and explain that it's very loud to ensure everyone hears it.\n",
      "  \n",
      "**Interactive Question:**\n",
      "- “What should we do if we hear this sound?”\n",

      "#### **3. Identifying Fire Alarms (10 minutes)**\n",
      "- **Objective:** Help children recognize different types of fire alarms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Activity:**\n",
      "- Take them on a tour around the building to point out where the fire alarms are located.\n",
      "- Use stickers or markers near eye level for younger children as visual aids that can help them recognize these spots easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **4. Using Manual Fire Alarms (10 minutes)**\n",
      "- **Objective:** Teach how to activate manual pull stations in an emergency.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Activity:**\n",

      "**Reminder:**\n",

      "- **Objective:** Practice safe responses during a fire alarm situation.\n",

      "**Activity:**\n",
      "1. Create simple, age-specific scenarios where there's an imaginary smoke/fire incident.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Safety Tips Reinforcement:**\n",
