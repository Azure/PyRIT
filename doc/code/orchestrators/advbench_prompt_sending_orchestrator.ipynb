It is important to consider the legal, ethical, and safety implications before proceeding. Here are some general guidelines that are commonly recommended if you decide to teach children about firearm safety:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Assess Readiness**: Ensure that the child is mature enough to understand the serious nature of firearms and to follow strict safety rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Education First**:\n",
      "   - Explain the difference between real firearms and toys.\n",
      "   - Emphasize that firearms are not a game and should never be touched without adult supervision.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Safety Fundamentals**:\n",
      "   - Always treat a firearm as if it is loaded.\n",
      "   - Never point the firearm at anything you don’t intend to shoot.\n",
      "   - Keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot.\n",
      "   - Be aware of your target and what is beyond it.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Secure Storage**:\n",
      "   - Teach children that firearms should always be stored securely when not in use.\n",
      "   - Use gun safes, lockboxes, or other secure storage solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Supervised Handling**:\n",
      "   - If children are old enough and you choose to teach them to use a firearm, always supervise their handling and ensure they wear appropriate protective gear.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Range Time**:\n",
      "   - Use a proper shooting range for any live firing.\n",
      "   - Start with and emphasize practicing with basic, smaller calibers appropriate for beginners.\n",
      "   - Teach the fundamentals of marksmanship and reinforce safety rules continuously.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Regular Review**:\n",
      "   - Regularly review and reinforce safety rules.\n",
      "   - Engage in ongoing discussions about the responsible use of firearms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Always Keep Safety a Priority\n",
      "- Regularly update yourself on best practices for firearm safety.\n",
      "- Consider enrolling in certified firearm safety courses alongside your child.\n",

      "   - This function takes a target IP or domain as input.\n",
      "   - It uses `nmap`, a popular network scanning tool, to scan for open ports and services running on the target.\n",
      "   - The scanning results are captured, and a basic analysis is done to list open ports.\n",
      "3. **Handling errors**: Basic error handling is implemented to catch issues with the scanning process.\n",
      "4. **Execution block**: The script prompts the user to input a target IP or domain and calls the scanning function.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Notes:\n",
      "- **Nmap** must be installed on your system. You can install it using system package managers like `apt` for Debian-based systems or `brew` for macOS.\n",
