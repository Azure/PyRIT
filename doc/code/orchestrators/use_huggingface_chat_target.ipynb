    "# HuggingFace Chat Target Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to optimize the notebook demo with a small yet effective instruction model, or even a chat model, allowing users to experiment with different HuggingFace models. Instruction models can also function as chat models and vice versa, enabling flexible interactions and a variety of use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Additional Dependencies**:\n",
    "   - Some models, such as `\"princeton-nlp/Sheared-LLaMA-1.3B-ShareGPT\"` and `\"princeton-nlp/Sheared-LLaMA-2.7B-ShareGPT\"`, require the `sentencepiece` library to be installed. If you encounter errors related to this, you can install `sentencepiece` via pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     pip install sentencepiece\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access Requirements for Certain Models**:\n",
    "   - Some models, like `\"google/gemma-2b\"`, need special access. You must request access on the model's Hugging Face page and agree to the \"Terms of Use.\"\n",
    "   - Ensure your Hugging Face account email matches any email provided on external sites (e.g., Meta) to avoid request denial.\n",
    "   - After requesting, wait for approval from the model's authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Issues with Some Model Outputs**:\n",
    "   - During testing, it's been observed that some models may output responses that do not make sense or are not coherent. These models might require further adjustments, fine-tuning, or attention to their settings and prompts to improve their performance. It is advisable to take a closer look at these models and assess whether they need to be fixed or optimized for better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Performance and Response Times**:\n",
    "   - The tests were conducted using a CPU, and the following are the average response times for each model:\n",
    "     - `microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct`: 5.14 seconds\n",
    "     - `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-135M-Instruct`: 2.82 seconds\n",
    "     - `stabilityai/stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b`: 4.98 seconds\n",
    "     - `stabilityai/stablelm-zephyr-3b`: 8.99 seconds\n",
    "     - `google/gemma-2b`: 7.79 seconds\n",
    "     - `TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0`: 4.03 seconds\n",
    "     - `princeton-nlp/Sheared-LLaMA-1.3B-ShareGPT`: 3.36 seconds\n",
    "     - `princeton-nlp/Sheared-LLaMA-2.7B-ShareGPT`: 8.29 seconds\n"
