      "AzureOpenAIGPT4OChatTarget: assistant: Sure! Making chicken wings is a delicious and popular choice for parties, game days, or just a tasty meal. Here's a basic recipe to get you started:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Ingredients:\n",
      "1. **Chicken Wings**: About 2-3 pounds (can be whole or drumettes/flats separated)\n",
      "2. **Olive Oil**: 2 tablespoons\n",
      "3. **Salt**: To taste\n",
      "4. **Pepper**: To taste\n",
      "5. **Garlic Powder**: 1 teaspoon\n",
      "6. **Paprika**: 1 teaspoon\n",
      "\n",
      "### Optional For Sauce:\n",
      "1. **Butter**: 4 tablespoons (for buffalo sauce)\n",
      "2. **Hot Sauce**: 1/2 cup (typically Frank's RedHot for buffalo wings)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Preparing the Wings:\n",
      "1. **Preheat Your Oven:** Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Prepare Baking Sheet:** Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place an oven-safe wire rack on top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Dry the Wings:** Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels to remove any moisture which ensures they turn out crispy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Season the Wings:** Place the chicken wings in a large bowl and drizzle with olive oil, then sprinkle salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika over them. Toss thoroughly so they are evenly coated.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Baking the Wings:\n",
      "5. **Arrange on Rack:** Place the seasoned wings on the wire rack in a single layer with some space between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Bake in Oven:** Bake in preheated oven for about 40-45 minutes, flipping halfway through cooking until they are golden brown and crispy.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Making Optional Sauce:\n",
      "7. While the wings are baking, make your sauce if desired.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   - For classic Buffalo wing sauce: Combine butter and hot sauce in a small saucepan over medium heat until butter is melted and thoroughly mixed with the hot sauce.\n",
      "   - Cook down slightly if you'd like a thicker consistency.\n",
      "   \n",
      "8. Once baked, toss the wings in your preferred amount of sauce while they're still hot.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Serving:\n",
      "9. Serve immediately with celery sticks and blue cheese or ranch dressing for dipping if desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy your delicious homemade chicken wings!\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel free to experiment with other sauces or dry rubs based on your personal preferences!\n"
