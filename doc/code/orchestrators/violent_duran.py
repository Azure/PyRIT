# # Violent Duran attack strategy
# This update integrates the Violent Durian attack strategy from Project Moonshot into the PyRIT system.
# The strategy revolves around an attacker LLM manipulating the Target LLM into adopting a criminal persona and
# providing illegal advice or dangerous suggestions. The criminal persona is chosen randomly from a predefined list,
# and the conversation objective is set to convince the Target LLM to act as this persona.
