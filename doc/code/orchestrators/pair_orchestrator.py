# # PAIR Orchestrator - optional
#
# This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use the Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR) PyRIT orchestrator. This orchestrator is designed to automate the process of refining a prompt to achieve a desired response from a target model. The orchestrator uses a pair of models, an attacker model and a target model, to iteratively refine a prompt to achieve a desired response from the target model. The orchestrator uses a number of conversation streams to explore the space of possible prompts and responses, and stops when a desired response is achieved.
#
# This attack was first described in the paper _Chao, Patrick, et al. "Jailbreaking black box large language models in twenty queries." arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.08419 (2023)_. The PAIR authors also provided a reference implementation in https://github.com/patrickrchao/JailbreakingLLMs.
#
# This notebook demonstrates how to use the PyRIT's PAIR implementation.
#
# Before you begin, ensure you are setup with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).
