# # PAIR Orchestrator
#
#
# This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use the Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR) PyRIT orchestrator. This orchestrator is designed to automate the process of refining a prompt to achieve a desired response from a target model. The orchestrator uses a pair of models, an attacker model and a target model, to iteratively refine a prompt to achieve a desired response from the target model. The orchestrator uses a number of conversation streams to explore the space of possible prompts and responses, and stops when a desired response is achieved.
#
# This attack was first described in the paper _Chao, Patrick, et al. "Jailbreaking black box large language models in twenty queries." arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.08419 (2023)_. The PAIR authors also provided a reference implementation in https://github.com/patrickrchao/JailbreakingLLMs.
#
# This notebook demonstrates how to use the PyRIT's PAIR implementation.
#
# Before you begin, ensure you are setup with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/).
#
#
# ## Orchestrator Initialization
#
# The PromptAutomaticIterativeRefinementOrchestrator is initialized with the following parameters:
# - `red_teaming_chat`: An instance of OpenAIChatTarget which represents the attacker model.
# - `conversation_objective`: The objective of the attacker model.
# - `prompt_target`: An instance of OpenAIChatTarget which represents the target model.
# - `verbose`: A boolean value to control the verbosity of the orchestrator.
# - `number_of_conversation_streams`: The number of conversation streams to explore.
# - `max_conversation_depth`: The maximum depth of the conversation.
# - `stop_on_first_success`: A boolean value to control whether the orchestrator should stop on the first success.
# - `desired_target_response_prefix`: The desired prefix for the target response.
# - `scorer`: A scorer which is used to score the responses from the target model on a scale.
# - `scorer_sensitivity`: The sensitivity of the scorer.
#   The closer the value is to 1 the less tolerance from the perfect score on the scale is allowed to qualify as a jailbreak.
#
# **Orchestrator Execution**: The orchestrator is run using the `run()` method, and the response is printed via the `print()` method.
#
# ## Expected Outputs
#
# The output of the `run()` method is a list of jailbreaks from the target model. If the `stop_on_first_success` parameter is set to `True`, the orchestrator will stop as soon as it gets one desired response from the target model, and this response will be the only item in the list. If `stop_on_first_success` is set to False, the list will contain all responses from the target model, up to the max_conversation_depth.
