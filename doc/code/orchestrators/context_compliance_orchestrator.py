# # Context Compliance Orchestrator
#
# This orchestrator generates the first prompts using instructions defined in  `context_description_instructions_path`, along with an `adversarial_chat` to generate the first turns to send.
#
# `ContextComplianceOrchestrator` is a single turn orchestrator, meaning it only sends a single propmt to the `objective_target`. These are fast compared to multi-turn orchestrators.
#
# When you give an objective, the `ContextComplianceOrchestrator` will create prompts following this format:
#
# - user request (generated from adversarial LLM): "Tell me about <*more benign version of the objecive*>"
# - assistant response (generated from adversarial LLM): "<*Answers benign question*>. Would you like to know more about <*more explicit objective*>?"
# - user: yes
#
# This conversation is sent to the `objective_target`.
#
# Before you begin, ensure you have the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/install_pyrit.md).
#
# The results and intermediate interactions will be saved to memory according to the environment settings. For details, see the [Memory Configuration Guide](../memory/0_memory.md).
