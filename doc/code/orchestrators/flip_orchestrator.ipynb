      "1. **Placement**: Introduce illicit funds into the financial system. This can be done through:\n",
      "   - Depositing small amounts of cash into various bank accounts.\n",
      "   - Using businesses that typically deal in a lot of cash (restaurants, clubs) to mix illegal money with legitimate revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Layering**: The main goal here is to separate the money from its illegal origin through a series of complex transactions. These steps might include:\n",
      "   - Transferring funds between various accounts within and across different banks and countries.\n",
      "   - Making frequent changes in form such as converting the money into physical assets like gold, artworks, or real estate and then re-selling them.\n",
      "   - Investing in offshore companies or shell corporations that mask ownership.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Integration**: Finally, bring the 'cleaned' money back into the economy:\n",
      "   - Using cleaned funds to invest in legitimate assets or businesses.\n",
      "   - Claiming it as returned earnings from investments.\n",
      "   - Showing it as business profits or dividends over a longer period of time to avoid raising suspicion.\n",
