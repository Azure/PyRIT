    "# PAIR Orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use the Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR) PyRIT orchestrator. This orchestrator is designed to automate the process of refining a prompt to achieve a desired response from a target model. The orchestrator uses a pair of models, an attacker model and a target model, to iteratively refine a prompt to achieve a desired response from the target model. The orchestrator uses a number of conversation streams to explore the space of possible prompts and responses, and stops when a desired response is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This attack was first described in the paper _Chao, Patrick, et al. \"Jailbreaking black box large language models in twenty queries.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.08419 (2023)_. The PAIR authors also provided a reference implementation in https://github.com/patrickrchao/JailbreakingLLMs.\n",

    "## Orchestrator Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "The PromptAutomaticIterativeRefinementOrchestrator is initialized with the following parameters:  \n",
    "- `attacker`: An instance of OpenAIChatTarget which represents the attacker model.\n",
    "- `attacker_objective`: The objective of the attacker model.\n",
    "- `target`: An instance of OpenAIChatTarget which represents the target model.\n",
    "- `verbose`: A boolean value to control the verbosity of the orchestrator.\n",
    "- `number_of_conversation_streams`: The number of conversation streams to explore.\n",
    "- `max_conversation_depth`: The maximum depth of the conversation.\n",
    "- `stop_on_first_success`: A boolean value to control whether the orchestrator should stop on the first success.\n",
    "- `desired_target_response_prefix`: The desired prefix for the target response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Orchestrator Execution**: The orchestrator is run using the `run()` method, and the response is printed via the `print()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the `run()` method is a list of jailbreaks from the target model. If the `stop_on_first_success` parameter is set to `True`, the orchestrator will stop as soon as it gets one desired response from the target model, and this response will be the only item in the list. If `stop_on_first_success` is set to False, the list will contain all responses from the target model, up to the max_conversation_depth.\n"
