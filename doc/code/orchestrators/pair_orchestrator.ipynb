    "# PAIR Orchestrator - optional\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use the Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR) PyRIT orchestrator. This orchestrator is designed to automate the process of refining a prompt to achieve a desired response from a target model. The orchestrator uses a pair of models, an attacker model and a target model, to iteratively refine a prompt to achieve a desired response from the target model. The orchestrator uses a number of conversation streams to explore the space of possible prompts and responses, and stops when a desired response is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This attack was first described in the paper _Chao, Patrick, et al. \"Jailbreaking black box large language models in twenty queries.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.08419 (2023)_. The PAIR authors also provided a reference implementation in https://github.com/patrickrchao/JailbreakingLLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the PyRIT's PAIR implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you are setup with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Orchestrator Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "The PromptAutomaticIterativeRefinementOrchestrator is initialized with the following parameters:\n",
    "- `adversarial_chat`: An instance of OpenAIChatTarget which represents the attacker model.\n",
    "- `conversation_objective`: The objective of the attacker model.\n",
    "- `objective_target`: An instance of OpenAIChatTarget which represents the target model.\n",
    "- `verbose`: A boolean value to control the verbosity of the orchestrator.\n",
    "- `number_of_conversation_streams`: The number of conversation streams to explore.\n",
    "- `max_conversation_depth`: The maximum depth of the conversation.\n",
    "- `stop_on_first_success`: A boolean value to control whether the orchestrator should stop on the first success.\n",
    "- `desired_target_response_prefix`: The desired prefix for the target response.\n",
    "- `scorer`: A scorer which is used to score the responses from the target model on a scale.\n",
    "- `scorer_sensitivity`: The sensitivity of the scorer.\n",
    "  The closer the value is to 1 the less tolerance from the perfect score on the scale is allowed to qualify as a jailbreak.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Orchestrator Execution**: The orchestrator is run using the `run()` method, and the response is printed via the `print()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the `run()` method is a list of jailbreaks from the target model. If the `stop_on_first_success` parameter is set to `True`, the orchestrator will stop as soon as it gets one desired response from the target model, and this response will be the only item in the list. If `stop_on_first_success` is set to False, the list will contain all responses from the target model, up to the max_conversation_depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The results and intermediate interactions will be saved to memory according to the environment settings. For details, see the [Memory Configuration Guide](../memory/0_memory.md)."
