# # Role Play Orchestrator
#
# `RolePlayOrchestrator` is a single turn orchestrator, meaning it only sends a single prompt to the `objective_target`. These are fast compared to multi-turn orchestrators.
#
# This orchestrator prepends some prompts defined in `role_play_definition`, along with an `adversarial_chat` to generate the first turns to send. Typically these prompts describe a fictional scenario to attempt and elicit harmful responses.
#
# Before you begin, ensure you have the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/install_pyrit.md).
#
# The results and intermediate interactions will be saved to memory according to the environment settings. For details, see the [Memory Configuration Guide](../memory/0_memory.md).
