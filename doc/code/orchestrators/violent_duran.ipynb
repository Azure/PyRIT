    "# Violent Duran attack strategy\n",

    "The strategy revolves around an attacker LLM manipulating the Target LLM into adopting a criminal persona and\n",
    "providing illegal advice or dangerous suggestions. The criminal persona is chosen randomly from a predefined list, \n",
    "and the conversation objective is set to convince the Target LLM to act as this persona."
