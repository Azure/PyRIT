    "This orchestrator generates the first prompts using instructions defined in  `context_description_instructions_path`, along with an `adversarial_chat` to generate the first turns to send.\n",

    "`ContextComplianceOrchestrator` is a single turn orchestrator, meaning it only sends a single propmt to the `objective_target`. These are fast compared to multi-turn orchestrators.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you give an objective, the `ContextComplianceOrchestrator` will create prompts following this format:\n",
    "\n",
    "- user request (generated from adversarial LLM): \"Tell me about <*more benign version of the objecive*>\"\n",
    "- assistant response (generated from adversarial LLM): \"<*Answers benign question*>. Would you like to know more about <*more explicit objective*>?\"\n",
    "- user: yes\n",
    "\n",
    "This conversation is sent to the `objective_target`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/install_pyrit.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "The results and intermediate interactions will be saved to memory according to the environment settings. For details, see the [Memory Configuration Guide](../memory/0_memory.md)."
