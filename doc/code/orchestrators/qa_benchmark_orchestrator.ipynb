      "2. `var_11` is set to the type-casted value of `var_8`, which in this case is 0xd7 (decimal 215).\n",
      "3. `var_12` depends on the truthiness of `var_5` (defined as a boolean). Since `var_5` (0x1a3ff563) is non-zero, this results in `var_12` being assigned to ((int)(signed char)-23), which is -23.\n",
