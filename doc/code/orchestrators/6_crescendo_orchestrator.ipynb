    "\n",
    "The Crescendo Attack is a strategy that gradually guides a model to generate harmful content through small, seemingly harmless steps. The `CrescendoOrchestrator` utilizes a red teaming chat target to create and send increasingly harmful prompts to the target chat bot. Initially, the generated prompts are benign, but they gradually become more dangerous. After each prompt is sent, the target chat bot's response is evaluated by the `CrescendoOrchestrator` to determine if it has produced harmful content. If the target chat bot refuses to respond, the `CrescendoOrchestrator` backtracks the red teaming chat target's memory and tries a different approach. If the chat bot does respond, the `CrescendoOrchestrator` evaluates whether the conversation objective has been achieved. If the objective has not been achieved, the red teaming chat will generate a new prompt and send it to the chat bot. This process continues until the chat bot produces harmful content or the maximum number of attempts is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for this to succeed, the `CrescendoOrchestrator` requires an LLM endpoint without content moderation or other safety filtering mechanisms. Even then, success may depend on the model and may not be guaranteed every time."
