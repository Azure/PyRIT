# # Red Teaming Orchestrator
#
# The Red Teaming Orchestrator is an orchestrator that sets up an attacker LLM to communicate with a target LLM.
#
# ## Multi-Turn Example
#
# In this example, we'll try to convince a chatbot to generate a keylogger. For this purpose, we use PyRIT's `RedTeamingOrchestrator` that leverages a red teaming LLM to generate prompts that are then sent to the target chatbot. Behind the scenes, this will use an AzureML endpoint to generate the prompts and send them to the target chatbot. The target chatbot will then respond to the prompts, and the responses will be scored by the `RedTeamingOrchestrator` to determine if the objective has been achieved. If the objective has not been achieved, the `RedTeamingOrchestrator` will generate a new prompt and send it to the target chatbot. This process will continue until the objective is achieved or a maximum number of attempts is reached.
#
# ![PyRIT operation setup](../../../assets/operation-setup.jpg)
#
# Note that for this to succeed, the `RedTeamingOrchestrator` requires an LLM endpoint without content moderation or other kinds of safety filtering mechanisms. Even then, success depends on the model and may not be achieved every time.
#
# Before you begin, ensure you are setup with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).
#
# The results and intermediate interactions will be saved to memory according to the environment settings. For details, see the [Memory Configuration Guide](../memory/0_memory.md).

# ## Image Target Example
#
# One of the most powerful things about PyRIT is its ability to generalize. You can use images
# in most places instead of text, and vice versa. In this example, we'll try to convince an image generation model to generate a harmful image.
#
# Notably, scoring happens with an Azure OpenAI GPT-V model that can process our scoring instructions
# plus image and generate a score based on the image content.
# The score is then used as feedback to the red teaming LLM to generate new prompts.
# Similarly, if the image generation prompt gets blocked by content filters we use that as
# feedback to the red teaming LLM.
# This process will continue until the objective is achieved (i.e., a harmful image is generated)
# or a maximum number of attempts is reached.
