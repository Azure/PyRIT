    "# Skeleton Key Orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Skeleton Key Attack Demo** showcases how an orchestrator can perform a multi-step AI jailbreak against a large language model (LLM). It demonstrates the effectiveness of using a two-step approach where the orchestrator first sends an initial \"skeleton key\" prompt to the model to bypass its safety and guardrails, followed by a secondary attack prompt that attempts to elicit harmful or restricted content. This demo is designed to test and evaluate the security measures and robustness of LLMs against adversarial attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Orchestrators are a powerful way to implement various attack techniques. This demo uses the `SkeletonKeyOrchestrator` in PyRIT to simulate and evaluate the model’s response to this particular type of jailbreak attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Skeleton Key Attack operates by initially sending a prompt designed to subvert the LLM's safety mechanisms. This initial prompt sets up the model to disregard its responsible AI guardrails. Following this, the orchestrator sends a second, harmful prompt to the model, testing whether it will comply now that its defenses have been bypassed. If the attack is successful, the model responds without the usual censorship or refusal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process allows researchers to test the effectiveness of safety measures implemented by LLM providers and helps to strengthen the model’s resilience against such attacks. Note that like other orchestrated attacks, success may vary depending on the model and its underlying architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have the correct version of PyRIT installed and that all secrets are configured as outlined in the [setup instructions](../../setup/)."
