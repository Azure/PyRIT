# ## Orchestrators
#
# The Orchestrator is a top level component that red team operators will interact with most. It is responsible for telling PyRIT what endpoints to connect to and how to send prompts. It can be thought of as the thing that executes on an attack technique
#
# In general, a strategy for tackling a scenario will be
#
# 1. Making/using a `PromptTarget`
# 1. Making/using a set of initial prompts
# 1. Making/using a `PromptConverter` (default is often to not transform)
# 1. Making/using a `Scorer` (this is often to self ask)
# 1. Making/using an `Orchestrator`
#
# Orchestrators can tackle complicated scenarios, but this example is about as simple as it gets (while still being useful). Here, we'll send all prompts in a file, use a converter to base64-encode the prompts, and send them to a PromptTarget.
#
# Note to run this demo you need to setup your `.env` file to properly authenticate to an Azure OpenAI endpoint as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).
