    "# 3. Cross-domain Prompt Injection Attacks (XPIA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Orchestrators can be used for various scenarios that are tangential to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "XPIAs occur when an attacker takes over a user's session with an AI by embedding their own instructions in a piece of content that the AI system is processing. In this demo, the entire flow is handled by the `XPIATestOrchestrator`. It starts with the attacker uploading a file to the Azure Blob Storage container, which contains the jailbreak prompt. We assume that the attacker is aware that the victim has an AI system summarizing uploaded files. Note that this can be interchanged with other attack setups, e.g., sending an email knowing that an LLM summarizes the contents, or uploading a resume to an applicant tracking system knowing that an LLM is analyzing it for suitability for the role. The summarization prompt triggers the XPIA by making the LLM process the jailbreak. Notably, the LLM may still be able to prevent being compromised depending on its metaprompt or other content filters.\n",

    "## RAG Vulnerability Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demonstration, we show a potential security weakness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using an example involving an AI-powered job application screener, referred to here as the \"AI Recruiter\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an AI Recruiter?\n",
    "An AI Recruiter is an automated system that evaluates job applicants by analyzing their resumes (CVs) and comparing them to job requirements using natural language processing and semantic similarity scoring. These systems often rely on RAG techniques to enhance performance by retrieving relevant context before generating a response or decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Being Demonstrated?\n",
    "This demonstration illustrates how an attacker could exploit prompt injection to influence the AI Recruiter's decision. Specifically, we show how a candidate—*Jonathon Sanchez*—can use hidden injected text in their resume to appear highly qualified for a role they are not suited for.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `XPIATestOrchestrator` to:\n",
    "- Generate a resume that contains hidden \"Relevant skills\" text intended to mislead the ranking algorithm.\n",
    "- Automatically upload this resume to the `/upload/` endpoint of the AI Recruiter.\n",
    "- Trigger the `/search_candidates/` endpoint to simulate a hiring query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Expect from the Output\n",
    "- The system returns a ranked list of candidates based on semantic similarity scores and vector distances.\n",
    "- Normally, high scores and low distances would indicate a well-matched candidate.\n",
    "- However, due to the prompt injection, *Jonathon Sanchez* may appear at or near the top of the list, despite lacking actual qualifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting the Results\n",
    "- This result demonstrates how RAG-based decision systems can be manipulated through unsanitized input.\n",
    "- It also underscores the importance of robust input validation and prompt hardening in AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
