# # 2. Multi-Turn Orchestrator
#
# `MultiTurnOrchestrators` are orchestrators that sets up an attacker LLM (called `adveresarial_chat` to communicate with an objective target (called `objective_target`).
#
# ## RedTeamingOrchestrator Example
#
# In this example, we'll try to convince a chatbot to generate a keylogger. For this purpose, we use PyRIT's `RedTeamingOrchestrator` that leverages a red teaming LLM to generate prompts that are then sent to the target chatbot. It is the simplest implementation of a `MultiTurnOrchestrator`.
#
# Behind the scenes, this will use an AzureML endpoint to generate the prompts and send them to the target chatbot. The target chatbot will then respond to the prompts, and the responses will be scored by the `RedTeamingOrchestrator` to determine if the objective has been achieved. If the objective has not been achieved, the `RedTeamingOrchestrator` will generate a new prompt and send it to the target chatbot. This process will continue until the objective is achieved or a maximum number of attempts is reached.
#
# ![PyRIT operation setup](../../../assets/operation-setup.jpg)
#
# Note that for this to succeed, the `RedTeamingOrchestrator` requires an LLM endpoint without serious content moderation or other kinds of safety filtering mechanisms. Success depends on the model and may not be achieved every time.
#
# Before you begin, ensure you are setup with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).

# ## Setting System Prompt of Objective Target
#
# The below example shows how to set the system prompt of the orchestrator's objective target through prepending a conversation.
# Note that it makes use of an OpenAIChatTarget as the objective target, since gpt-4 accepts setting of system prompts.
#
# Other scenarios that make use of this functionality:
# - Resend conversation history to the objective target (e.g. if there was an exception, and you want to continue the conversation from where it left off)
# - Customize the last user message sent to the objective target (orchestrator will send this to the target instead of generating a new adversarial message)
# - Any attack that may need to have conversation history already preloaded before handing off to the orchestrator

# ## Parallel Example using Converters
#
# The below example has a few one-line changes, and is written to give you an idea of how `MultiTurnOrchestrators` can be configured.
#
# - Like most orchestrators, `MultiTurnOrchestrators` take a list of `PromptConverters` on initialization. These are applied to transform the prompts as they are sent. In the below example, we use a simple `EmojiConverter` to transform all characters to look-alikes.
# - You can also run the above attack in parallel changing one line of code.
# - Additionally, the below attack uses an `OpenAIChatTarget` as the `objective_target` (like above)

# ## Image Target Example
#
# One of the most powerful things about PyRIT is its ability to generalize. You can use images
# in most places instead of text, and vice versa. In this example, we'll try to convince an image generation model to generate a harmful image.
#
# Notably, scoring happens with an Azure OpenAI GPT-V model that can process our scoring instructions
# plus image and generate a score based on the image content.
# The score is then used as feedback to the red teaming LLM to generate new prompts.
# Similarly, if the image generation prompt gets blocked by content filters we use that as
# feedback to the red teaming LLM.
# This process will continue until the objective is achieved (i.e., a harmful image is generated)
# or a maximum number of attempts is reached.

# ## Other Multi-Turn Orchestrators
#
# The above attacks should work using other `MultiTurnOrchestrators` with minimal modification. If you want to use [PAIR](./pair_orchestrator.ipynb), [TAP](./tree_of_attacks_with_pruning.ipynb), or [Crescendo](./5_crescendo_orchestrator.ipynb) - this should be almost as easy as swapping out the orchestrator initialization. These algorithms are always more effective than `RedTeamingOrchestrator`, which is a simiple algorithm. However, `RedTeamingOrchestrator` by its nature supports more targets - because it doesn't modify conversation history it can support any `PromptTarget` and not only `PromptChatTargets`.
