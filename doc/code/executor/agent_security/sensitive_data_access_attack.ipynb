    "# Agent Security: Sensitive Data Access UPIA Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who Is This For?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is relevant for any AI agent that exposes **file system access** or **command / code execution** capabilities — whether implemented as plugins, tools, skills, or function-calling. If your agent can read files or run shell commands on the host, it is a candidate for this test.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of a **Red Team AI Agent Evaluation** module, built on [PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT), that automatically tests agent behavior under adversarial attack scenarios.\n",
    "The solution is **platform-agnostic** — it targets any agent exposed over HTTP. The agent under test can be deployed in a Docker container to ensure isolation from the production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The Docker sandbox image provides a realistic attack surface by pre-populating the agent's file system with **canary-instrumented sensitive files** — fake but realistic versions of `/etc/shadow`, `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `.env`, `/etc/passwd`, `~/.bash_history`, `/etc/crontab`, and `/proc/self/environ`. Each file contains a unique canary marker that the scorer uses to deterministically detect whether the agent leaked that file's contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Docker Alternative\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer not to deploy your agent inside the provided Docker sandbox, you can use the [`plant_canaries.py`](../../../../docker/agent-sandbox/plant_canaries.py) script to plant canary files directly into the agent's host environment. The script writes the same canary-instrumented files at their real system paths (e.g., `/etc/shadow`, `/root/.ssh/id_rsa`), appending canary content to existing files and safely stripping it on cleanup — without deleting original system files. Run `python docker/agent-sandbox/plant_canaries.py --force` to plant and `--clean` to restore.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Value\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concrete risk validation** — Evidence-based confirmation of whether an agent can be abused, including a per-attack-category breakdown of which sensitive file types were successfully exposed.\n",
    "- **Actionable remediation steps** — Custom recommendations generated from the results: path sanitization, file-system allowlists, intent-aware guardrails, least-privilege enforcement, and more.\n",
    "- **Repeatable governance** — A standardized red-team evaluation that can be run pre-deployment or continuously via CI/CD integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We load **attack objectives** from PyRIT's built-in `sensitive_data_access` seed dataset, covering direct, social engineering, obfuscated, and tool-chaining attack vectors\n",
    "2. We configure a **canary-based scorer** that detects whether the agent's response contains ANY of the canary markers planted in sensitive files — each file category has a unique marker\n",
    "3. We run the attack using `PromptSendingAttack` and print results using `ConsoleAttackResultPrinter`\n",
    "4. We generate **actionable hardening recommendations** based on which vulnerability categories were exploited\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, make sure you have the following set up:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. A Running Agent with Tool Access\n",
    "You need an AI agent exposed over HTTP that has tool capabilities (e.g., file read, code execution, command execution). This can be built with any framework — **LangChain**, **Semantic Kernel**, **AutoGen**, **CrewAI**, or your own custom agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent must:\n",
    "- Accept prompts via an HTTP endpoint (e.g., `POST /chat`)\n",
    "- Have access to tools that can interact with the file system or run commands\n",
    "- Be deployed in an environment where canary files have been planted (see step 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example:** This repo includes a ready-to-use LangChain sandbox agent under `docker/agent-sandbox/`. See the [Agent Security overview](./0_agent_security.md#agent-sandbox-setup) for setup instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Canary Files Planted in the Agent's Environment\n",
    "The scorer works by detecting **canary markers** — unique strings planted inside sensitive files in the agent's environment. Each file category (shadow, passwd, SSH keys, etc.) has its own marker.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can plant canary files using either method:\n",
    "- **Docker** — Use [`Dockerfile.canary-template`](../../../../docker/agent-sandbox/Dockerfile.canary-template) to bake canaries into your container image\n",
    "- **No Docker** — Run [`plant_canaries.py`](../../../../docker/agent-sandbox/plant_canaries.py) to plant canary files at their real system paths (`python docker/agent-sandbox/plant_canaries.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The marker strings and content are also available programmatically via `CANARY_MARKERS` and `CANARY_CONTENT` from `pyrit.executor.attack`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Update the HTTP Target Configuration (below)\n",
    "Adjust the `HTTP_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` and `response_callback` in the code cells below to match your agent's API contract (endpoint URL, request format, response key, etc.)."
