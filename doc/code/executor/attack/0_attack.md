# Attacks

The Attack is a top-level component that red team operators will interact with the most. It is responsible for telling PyRIT which endpoints to connect to and how to send prompts. It can be thought of as the component that executes an attack technique.

An Attack is made up of four components:

```{mermaid}

    A(["Attack Strategy <br>"])
    A --consumes--> B(["Attack Context <br>"])
    A --takes in as parameters within __init__--> D(["Attack Configurations (Adversarial, Scoring, Converter)"])
    A --produces--> C(["Attack Result <br>"])
```

To execute an Attack, one generally follows this pattern:
1. Create an **attack context** containing state information (i.e. attack objective, memory labels, prepended conversations, seed prompts)
2. Initialize an **attack strategy** (with optional **attack configurations** for converters, scorers, and adversarial chat targets)
3. _Execute_ the attack strategy with the created context
4. Recieve and process the **attack result**

## Types of Attacks

- [**Single-Turn Attacks**](./single_turn/0_single_turn.md): Single-turn attacks typically send prompts to a target endpoint to try to achieve a specific objective within a single turn. These attack strategies evaluate the target response using optional scorers to determine if the objective has been met.

- [**Multi-Turn Attacks**](./multi_turn/0_multi_turn.md): Multi-turn attacks introduce an iterative attack process where an adversarial chat model generates prompts to send to a target system, attempting to achieve a specified objective over multiple turns. This strategy also evaluates the response using a scorer to determine if the objective has been met. These attacks continue iterating until the objective is met or a maximum numbers of turns is attempted. These types of attacks tend to work better than single-turn attacks in eliciting harm if a target endpoint keeps track of conversation history.
