    "# 3. Crescendo Attack (Multi-Turn)\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo showcases the use of the `CrescendoAttack` in PyRIT.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Crescendo Attack](https://crescendo-the-multiturn-jailbreak.github.io/) is a strategy that gradually guides a model to generate harmful content through small, seemingly harmless steps. The `CrescendoAttack` utilizes an adversarial LLM to create and send increasingly harmful prompts to the target endpoint. After each prompt is sent, the target endpoint's response is evaluated by the `CrescendoAttack` to determine if it has produced harmful content. If the target endpoint refuses to respond, the `CrescendoAttack` backtracks the adversarial LLM's memory and tries a different approach. If the endpoint does respond, the `CrescendoAttack` evaluates whether the conversation objective has been achieved. If the objective has not been achieved, the adversarial LLM will generate a new prompt and send it to the target endpoint. This process continues until the target endpoint produces harmful content or the maximum number of attempts is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this attack is more likely to succeed if the adversarial LLM provided does not have content moderation or other safety mechanisms. Even then, success may depend on the model and may not be guaranteed every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../../setup/populating_secrets.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "The results and intermediate interactions will be saved to memory according to the environment settings. For details, see the [Memory Configuration Guide](../../memory/0_memory.md)."
