# # Tree of Attacks with Pruning (Multi-Turn) - optional
#
# The `TreeOfAttacksWithPruningAttack` (aka `TAPAttack`) implements the [TAP attack strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02119).

# The TAP attack strategy systematically explores multiple adversarial prompt paths in parallel
# using a tree structure. It employs breadth-first search with pruning to efficiently find
# effective jailbreaks while managing computational resources.

# How it works:
# 1. **Initialization**: Creates multiple initial attack branches (width) to explore different approaches
# 2. **Tree Expansion**: For each iteration (depth), branches are expanded by a branching factor
# 3. **Prompt Generation**: Each node generates adversarial prompts via an LLM red-teaming assistant
# 4. **Evaluation**: Responses are evaluated for objective achievement and on-topic relevance
# 5. **Pruning**: Low-scoring or off-topic branches are pruned to maintain the width constraint
# 6. **Iteration**: The process continues until the objective is achieved or max depth is reached
#
# The strategy balances exploration (trying diverse approaches) with exploitation (focusing on
# promising paths) through its pruning mechanism.
#
# Note:
# The TAP attack is particularly effective for complex objectives that benefit from systematic
# exploration. The tree visualization in the result provides insights into the attack's
# decision-making process.
#
# The results and intermediate interactions will be saved to memory according to the environment settings. For details, see the [Memory Configuration Guide](../../memory/0_memory.md).
