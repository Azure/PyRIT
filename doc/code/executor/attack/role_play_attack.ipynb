    "Any converters that you provide will be applied to the prompt that has already been converted by the role play definition (using the provided `adversarial_chat` target). You may see better success if you provide a LLM that has no content moderation or other safety mechanisms. Otherwise, it may refuse to convert the prompt as expected.\n",
