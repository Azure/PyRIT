    "This attack prepends some prompts defined in `role_play_definition`, along with an `adversarial_chat` target LLM to generate the first turns to send. Typically these prompts describe a fictional scenario to attempt and elicit harmful responses.\n",
    "Any converters that you provide will be applied to the prompt that has already been converted by the role play definition (using the provided `adversarial_chat` target). You may see better success if you provide a LLM that has no content moderation or other safety mechanisms. Otherwise, it may refuse to convert the prompt as expected.\n",
