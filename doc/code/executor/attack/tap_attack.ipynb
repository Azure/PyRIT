    "# Tree of Attacks with Pruning (Multi-Turn) - optional\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TreeOfAttacksWithPruningAttack` (aka `TAPAttack`) implements the [TAP attack strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02119).\n",
    "\n",
    "The TAP attack strategy systematically explores multiple adversarial prompt paths in parallel\n",
    "using a tree structure. It employs breadth-first search with pruning to efficiently find\n",
    "effective jailbreaks while managing computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Creates multiple initial attack branches (width) to explore different approaches\n",
    "2. **Tree Expansion**: For each iteration (depth), branches are expanded by a branching factor\n",
    "3. **Prompt Generation**: Each node generates adversarial prompts via an LLM red-teaming assistant\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**: Responses are evaluated for objective achievement and on-topic relevance\n",
    "5. **Pruning**: Low-scoring or off-topic branches are pruned to maintain the width constraint\n",
    "6. **Iteration**: The process continues until the objective is achieved or max depth is reached\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy balances exploration (trying diverse approaches) with exploitation (focusing on\n",
    "promising paths) through its pruning mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "The TAP attack is particularly effective for complex objectives that benefit from systematic\n",
    "exploration. The tree visualization in the result provides insights into the attack's\n",
    "decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results and intermediate interactions will be saved to memory according to the environment settings. For details, see the [Memory Configuration Guide](../../memory/0_memory.md)."
