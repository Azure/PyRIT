    "# 2. Red Teaming Attack (Multi-Turn)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-turn attacks implement strategies that attempt to achieve an objective against a LLM endpoint over several turns. These types of attacks are useful against endpoints that keep track of conversation history and can be more effective in achieving an objective than single-turn attacks.\n",
    "In PyRIT, each multi-turn attack will require defining an `AttackAdversarialConfig`, where you can specify which LLM to use as the adversarial chat target. This LLM is used for the purpose of generating adversarial prompts that align with the attack strategy, so that the entire multi-turn attack\n",
    "can be run in an automated fashion in order to achieve the objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this doc, we'll try to convince a LLM to give us instructions on how to make a Molotov cocktail (a dangerous incendiary device). To do so, we use the `RedTeamingAttack` that leverages another LLM to generate adversarial prompts that are then sent to the target endpoint. It is the simplest implementation of a multi-turn attack within PyRIT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, this example use an OpenAI model endpoint to generate the prompts and send them to the target endpoint (an Azure ML model). The responses from the target endpoint are evaluated and scored by the objective scorer provided in the `AttackScoringConfig` to determine if the objective has been achieved. If the objective has not been achieved, the `RedTeamingAttack` will generate a new prompt and send it to the target. This process continues until the objective is achieved or a maximum number of attempts is reached.\n",

    "The above examples should work using other multi-turn attacks with minimal modification. Check out attacks under `pyrit.executor.attack.multi_turn` for other examples, like Crescendo and Tree of Attacks. These algorithms are always more effective than `RedTeamingAttack`, which is a simple algorithm. However, `RedTeamingAttack` by its nature supports more targets - because it doesn't modify conversation history it can support any `PromptTarget` and not only `PromptChatTargets`."
