# # Flip Attack (Single-Turn) - optional
#
# Flip Attack is a simple attack. The paper is available here: https://arxiv.org/html/2410.02832v1.
#
# We replicate the ability to send prompts that match this output: https://github.com/yueliu1999/FlipAttack/blob/main/result/FlipAttack-gpt-4.json. In other words, it sends a system prompt to the target, directing it to unflip the word, and then it flips the malicious prompt.
#
# Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../../setup/install_pyrit.md).
#
# The results and intermediate interactions will be saved to memory according to the environment settings. For details, see the [Memory Configuration Guide](../../memory/0_memory.md).
