# # Violent Durian Attack (Multi-Turn) - optional
#
# This update integrates the [Violent Durian](https://github.com/aiverify-foundation/moonshot-data/blob/main/attack-modules/violent_durian.py) attack strategy from Project Moonshot.
# The strategy revolves around an attacker LLM manipulating the Target LLM into adopting a criminal persona and
# providing illegal advice or dangerous suggestions. The criminal persona is chosen randomly from a predefined list,
# and the conversation objective is set to convince the Target LLM to act as this persona.
