# # 2. Red Teaming Attack (Multi-Turn)
#
# Multi-turn attacks implement strategies that attempt to achieve an objective against a LLM endpoint over several turns. These types of attacks are useful against endpoints that keep track of conversation history and can be more effective in achieving an objective than single-turn attacks.
# In PyRIT, each multi-turn attack will require defining an `AttackAdversarialConfig`, where you can specify which LLM to use as the adversarial chat target. This LLM is used for the purpose of generating adversarial prompts that align with the attack strategy, so that the entire multi-turn attack
# can be run in an automated fashion in order to achieve the objective.
#
# In this doc, we'll try to convince a LLM to give us instructions on how to make a Molotov cocktail (a dangerous incendiary device). To do so, we use the `RedTeamingAttack` that leverages another LLM to generate adversarial prompts that are then sent to the target endpoint. It is the simplest implementation of a multi-turn attack within PyRIT.
#
# Behind the scenes, this example use an OpenAI model endpoint to generate the prompts and send them to the target endpoint (an Azure ML model). The responses from the target endpoint are evaluated and scored by the objective scorer provided in the `AttackScoringConfig` to determine if the objective has been achieved. If the objective has not been achieved, the `RedTeamingAttack` will generate a new prompt and send it to the target. This process continues until the objective is achieved or a maximum number of attempts is reached.

#
# Note that for this to succeed, the `AttackAdversarialConfig` requires an LLM endpoint without serious content moderation or other kinds of safety filtering mechanisms. Success depends on the model and may not be achieved every time.

# ## Setting System Prompt of Objective Target
#
# The below example shows how to set the system prompt of the attack's objective target through prepending a conversation.
# Note that it makes use of an OpenAIChatTarget as the objective target, since gpt-4 accepts setting of system prompts.
# Otherwise, the configurations and objective are the same as the above example.
#
# Other scenarios that make use of this functionality:
# - Resend conversation history to the objective target (e.g. if there was an exception, and you want to continue the conversation from where it left off)
# - Customize the last user message sent to the objective target (the attack will send this to the target instead of generating a new adversarial message for that turn)
# - Any attack that may need to have conversation history already preloaded

# ## Image Target Example
#
# One of the most powerful things about PyRIT is its ability to generalize. You can use images
# in most places instead of text, and vice versa. In this example, we'll try to convince an image generation model to generate a harmful image.
#
# Notably, scoring happens with an Azure OpenAI GPT-V model that can process our scoring instructions
# plus image and generate a score based on the image content.
# The score is then used as feedback to the red teaming LLM to generate new prompts.
# Similarly, if the image generation prompt gets blocked by content filters we use that as
# feedback to the red teaming LLM.
# This process will continue until the objective is achieved (i.e., a harmful image is generated)
# or a maximum number of attempts is reached.

# ## Other Multi-Turn Attacks
#
# The above examples should work using other multi-turn attacks with minimal modification. Check out attacks under `pyrit.executor.attack.multi_turn` for other examples, like Crescendo and Tree of Attacks. These algorithms are always more effective than `RedTeamingAttack`, which is a simple algorithm. However, `RedTeamingAttack` by its nature supports more targets - because it doesn't modify conversation history it can support any `PromptTarget` and not only `PromptChatTargets`.
