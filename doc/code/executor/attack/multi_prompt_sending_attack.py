# # Multi-Prompt Sending Attack - optional
#
# `MultiPromptSendingAttack` is a multi-turn prompt sending attack strategy that allows you to send a predefined sequence of prompts to a target one after the other to try to achieve a specific objective. This is functionally similar to iterating over single prompts with `PromptSendingAttack`, but as one single attack instead of separate ones.
#
# The use case is that some attacks are most effective as a predefined sequence of prompts, without the need for an adversarial target to generate prompts on the fly, but the attack does not work as a single prompt attack (or at least not as well). Think of it as some predefined crescendo attack.
#
# To keep it simple, there is no early stopping during the prompt sequence, neither in case of a refusal for one of the earlier steps, nor in case of early success before the last step.
#
# This simple demo showcases how to use the attack to send prompts, and how it is scored with a refusal scorer.
