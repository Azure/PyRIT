    "# Beam Search Attack Example\n",
    "\n",
    "`BeamSearchAttack` is a single turn attack strategy which generates a set of candidate attacks\n",
    " by iteratively expanding and scoring them, retaining only the top candidates at each step (note\n",
    " that there will be many calls to the model, but they will be extending the same conversation\n",
    " turn). To achieve this, the target must support grammar-based generation (each step provides\n",
    " the output of the previous step as a prefix, constraining the model to extend that prefix\n",
    " with a limited number of additional characters). At the time of writing, only the\n",
    "`OpenAIResponseTarget` supports this type of generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This attack requires two types of scorer: the objective scorer, which scores the attack\n",
    "candidates based on how well they achieve the attack goal, and at least one auxiliary\n",
    "scorer, which provides a floating point score which is used to prune the list of candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, import the necessary libraries and ensure you are setup with the correct version\n",
    "of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described\n",
