# # Role Play Attack (Single-Turn) - optional
#
# This attack prepends some prompts defined in `role_play_definition`, along with an `adversarial_chat` target LLM to generate the first turns to send. Typically these prompts describe a fictional scenario to attempt and elicit harmful responses.
# Any converters that you provide will be applied to the prompt that has already been converted by the role play definition (using the provided `adversarial_chat` target). You may see better success if you provide a LLM that has no content moderation or other safety mechanisms. Otherwise, it may refuse to convert the prompt as expected.
#
# Before you begin, ensure you have the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../../setup/install_pyrit.md).
#
# The results and intermediate interactions will be saved to memory according to the environment settings. For details, see the [Memory Configuration Guide](../../memory/0_memory.md).
