# # 1. Anecdoctor Prompt Generator
#
# This demo showcases the use of the `AnecdoctorGenerator` in PyRIT.
#
# Anecdoctoring is a method for using in-the-wild examples to develop an attack prompt that can be used to create more of the same type of attack.
# It was originally developed to construct multilingual information and communication-based attacks with high fidelity,
# but can be adapted to other cases where you have example attacks.
# Below, we use a simulated example: researchers seeking to implement the method may consider using fact-check data in ClaimReview format
# (see e.g. [Fact-Check Insights](https://www.factcheckinsights.org/) from the Duke Reporter's Lab).
#
# There are two options for the prompt generation strategy:
#
# 1. Few-shot prompting: Include attacks as examples and ask an LLM to create a prompt for a similar attack
# 2. Knowledge graph-augmented promption: Use example attacks to construct a knowledge graph which is in turn included in context to generate a new attack prompt.
#
# Using knowledge graph-augmented generation can improve attack realism and coherence to the original data.
# It requires an additional processing step, which produces the knowledge graph in JSON format.
# Note that this technique, as with other executors, is more likely to succeed if you have a model endpoint
# without content moderation or other safety mechanisms, and success rates
# will vary depending on the model, topic, and example data.
#
# Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../../setup/populating_secrets.md).
#
# The results and intermediate interactions will be saved to memory according to the environment settings. For details, see the [Memory Configuration Guide](../../memory/0_memory.md).

# The use of knowledge graph-augmented prompting can be particularly valuable when working with data across languages and cultures.
# The `AnecdoctorGenerator` has the option to change the operation's language as well as the type of content generated.
#
# Note that for best results, we recommend clustering examples as
# the approach works best when prompts are generated from sets of
# attacks with reasonable internal consistency.
