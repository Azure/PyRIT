# Prompt Generator

The Prompt Generator is used to create adversarial prompts using various strategies. They are a useful component to use to augment your prompt dataset(s) for evaluating the safety and security of generative AI systems.

Some strategies include:

- The [Anecdoctor](./1_anecdoctor_generator.ipynb) prompt generator develops adversarial prompts using in-the-wild examples through a few-shot prompting or knowledge graph-augmented approach.
- The [GPTFuzzer](./fuzzer_generator.ipynb) prompt generator uses a strategy based on GPTFuzzer by Yu et al. to generate new jailbreak templates from existing templates by applying various [fuzzer converter](../../../../pyrit/prompt_converter/fuzzer_converter/fuzzer_converter_base.py) techniques.

All generators have configurable converter configurations and custom contexts, and produce a result. Some have custom result printers to add better formatting.
