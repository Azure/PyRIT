# Benchmark

The Benchmark component is used to evaluate model performance and safety. For example, the [Q&A Benchmark](./1_qa_benchmark.ipynb) strategy evaluates a target model's ability to answer questions from a provided dataset. This can give more insight into model ability over different criteria areas.

All benchmarks have configurable converter and scoring configurations and custom contexts, and produce a result that can be further analyzed.
