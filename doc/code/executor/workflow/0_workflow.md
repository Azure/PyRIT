Workflows orchestrate complex multi-step operations that do not quite fit in with other executor categories of attack, prompt generation, or benchmark.

This is the most generic component under the `pyrit.executor` module. Continue on to see an example of a workflow in the docs for the [XPIA Workflow](./1_xpia_workflow.ipynb).
