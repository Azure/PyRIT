# # Scoring
#
# Scoring is a main component of the PyRIT architecture. It is primarily used to evaluate what happens to a prompt. It can be used to help answer questions like:
#
# - Was prompt injection detected?
# - Was the prompt blocked? Why?
# - Was there any harmful content in the response? What was it? How bad was it?
#
# This notebook shows how to use scorers directly.
#
# ### Setup
#
# Before starting this, make sure you are [set up and authenticated to use Azure OpenAI endpoints](../setup/setup_azure.md)
#
# ### True False Scoring
#
# In the simplest case a scorer can answer a question. The following example uses a `SelfAskTrueFalseScorer` to see if prompt injection was successful. This type of scorer is really useful in orchestrators that have to make decisions based on responses.

# ## Likert Scale Scoring
#
# In some cases, we are interested in scoring a response on a Likert scale that measures the prevalence or severity of some type of content.
#
# In this example, we use the `SelfAskLikertScorer` to measure the severity of political misinformation in a text string.
# Looking at the scored responses, we see that the `text_with_political_misinfo` is scored as 'Severe misinformation', while `text_without_political_misinfo` is scored as 'No misinformation'.
