# # Scoring
#
# This Jupyter notebook gives an introduction on how to use PyRIT to score responses automatically. Currently, two main types of scorers are available:
# - `SelfAskGptClassifier`: classifies a response into one of several categories (e.g., detecting whether a text string contains a prompt injection)
# - `SelfAskGptLikertScale`: classifies a response into one of several levels on a Likert scale (e.g., scoring the severity of misinformation within a text string)
#
# Both of these scorers inherit from the `SelfAskScore` class, which you can also use to create a custom scorer as follows:
#
# ```
# CustomScorer = SelfAskScore(
#     prompt_template_path=custom_prompt_template,
#     content_classifier=custom_classifier,
#     chat_target=chat_target
# )
# ```
#
# ## Classification Scoring
#
# In this first example, we set up a `SelfAskGptClassifier` and use it to determine whether a text string contains a prompt injection.
#
# Before starting this, make sure you are [set up and authenticated to use Azure OpenAI endpoints](../setup/setup_azure.md)

# ## Likert Scale Scoring
#
# In some cases, we are interested in scoring a response on a Likert scale that measures the prevalence or severity of some type of content.
#
# In this example, we use the `SelfAskLikertScorer` to measure the severity of political misinformation in a text string.
