    "1. **Set the Environment Variable:**\n",
    "   - Add the obtained API key to an environment variable named `AZURE_ML_KEY`.\n",

       "\"Hello! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about data structures and algorithms. Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that are used to organize and process data efficiently. They are essential for solving complex problems and are used in various fields such as software development, systems design, and machine learning.\\n\\nData structures refer to ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that they can be accessed and modified efficiently. Examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.\\n\\nAlgorithms, on the other hand, refer to a set of instructions that are followed to solve a particular problem. They can be implemented using various data structures, and their efficiency depends on the choice of data structures.\\n\\nUnderstanding data structures and algorithms can help you write more efficient and elegant code, and it can also help you prepare for technical interviews in the software industry.\\n\\nFeel free to ask me any questions you have, and I will do my best to help you!\""
