    "1. **Obtain the API Key:**\n",
    "   - Navigate to the AML Studio.\n",

       "\"Hello! I'm here to help you with any Excel-related questions you have. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, I'm happy to assist you in using Excel to its full potential. Just let me know what you need help with, and I'll do my best to provide clear and concise answers.\\n\\nIf you're new to Excel or need a refresher on the basics, here are a few key concepts to get started:\\n\\n* Spreadsheets are organized into rows and columns. Each intersection of a row and a column is called a cell.\\n* You can enter data and formulas into cells. When you enter data into a cell, it's called a value. When you enter a formula into a cell, it's called a formula.\\n* Formulas allow you to perform calculations on values in cells. For example, you can use a formula to add the values in two cells, or to find the average of a range of cells.\\n* Excel includes a wide range of functions that you can use in formulas to perform more complex calculations. For example, the SUM function adds the values in a range of cells, and the AVERAGE function finds the average of a range of cells.\\n* Excel also includes formatting options that allow you to customize the appearance of your data. You can use formatting to change the font, color, and size of text, as well as to add borders and shading to cells.\\n\\nI hope this helps you get started with Excel! If you have any questions, just let me know. I'm here to help.\""
