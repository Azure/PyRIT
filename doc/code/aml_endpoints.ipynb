    "1. **Obtain the API Key:**\n",
    "   - Navigate to the AML Studio.\n",
    "   - Go to the 'Endpoints' section.\n",
    "   - Retrieve the API key and endpoint URI.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Set the Environment Variable:**\n",
    "   - Add the obtained API key to an environment variable named `AZURE_ML_KEY`.\n",
    "   - Add the obtained endpoint URI to an environment variable named `AZURE_ML_MANAGED_ENDPOINT`.\n",

Statistics is the science of extracting meaning from data, and it's a fundamental part of many fields, including business, economics, engineering, biology, psychology, and many others. I can help you understand statistical concepts, explain the results of statistical analyses, and provide guidance on how to design experiments and surveys to collect data. I can also help you learn how to use statistical software packages, such as R or SAS, to perform your own data analyses. So, what can I help you with today?\""
