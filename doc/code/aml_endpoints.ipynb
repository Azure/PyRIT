    "1. **Obtain the API Key:**\n",
    "   - Navigate to the AML Studio.\n",
    "   - Go to the 'Endpoints' section.\n",
    "   - Retrieve the API key and endpoint URI.\n",

    "1. **Set the Environment Variable:**\n",
    "   - Add the obtained API key to an environment variable named `AZURE_ML_API_KEY`.\n",

       "\"Hello! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about data science, machine learning, or programming. Is there something specific you'd like to know or discuss? I'll do my best to provide a clear and helpful answer.\\n\\nData science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It involves techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information science.\\n\\nMachine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows a system to learn from data rather than through explicit programming. It is based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\\n\\nProgramming is the process of writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. This source code is written in a programming language, which is a set of instructions that a computer can understand and execute.\\n\\nI'm happy to help you with any questions you have about these or other topics. Just let me know how I can assist you.\""
