    "1. **Deploy an AML-Managed Online Endpoint:** Confirm that an Azure Machine Learning managed online endpoint is already deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Obtain the API Key:**\n",
    "   - Navigate to the AML Studio.\n",
    "   - Go to the 'Endpoints' section.\n",
    "   - Retrieve the API key and endpoint URI.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Set the Environment Variable:**\n",
    "   - Add the obtained API key to an environment variable named `AZURE_ML_API_KEY`.\n",
    "   - Add the obtained endpoint URI to an environment variable named `AZURE_ML_MANAGED_ENDPOINT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a AMLOnlineEndpointChat\n",

       "\"Hello! I'm here to help you with any questions you have about data structures and algorithms or computer science in general. Is there something specific you'd like to know?\\n\\nData structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that are used to solve problems efficiently. Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and modified efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.\\n\\nAlgorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving a problem or performing a task. They often involve using data structures to store and manipulate data in a way that allows the algorithm to run efficiently. Good algorithms are efficient, easy to understand, and flexible, meaning that they can be adapted to solve a variety of problems.\\n\\nDo you have any specific questions about data structures or algorithms? I'd be happy to help!\""
