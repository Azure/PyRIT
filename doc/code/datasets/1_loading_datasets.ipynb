    "# 1. Loading Built-in Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "PyRIT includes many built-in datasets to help you get started with AI red teaming. While PyRIT aims to be unopinionated about what constitutes harmful content, it provides easy mechanisms to use datasets—whether built-in, community-contributed, or your own custom datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: Datasets are best managed through [PyRIT memory](../memory/8_seed_database.ipynb), where data is normalized and can be queried efficiently. However, this guide demonstrates how to load datasets directly as a starting point, and these can easily be imported into the database later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following command lists all built-in datasets available in PyRIT. Some datasets are stored locally, while others are fetched remotely from sources like HuggingFace."
