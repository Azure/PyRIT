In order to better understand the organization of the data, we will first start by defining what a `SeedPrompt` is. A `SeedPrompt` can either be a prompt template with parameters such as `{{gender}}` or just a prompt. By loading a YAML file as a `SeedDataset`, we can use the prompts in other components within PyRIT."
