# ### Converters
#
# Converters are used to transform prompts before sending them to the target.
#
# This can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as encoding the prompt in a different format, or adding additional information to the prompt. For example, you might want to convert a prompt to base64 before sending it to the target, or add a prefix to the prompt to indicate that it is a question.
#
# Converters can be used to perform these types of transformations. Here is a simple program that uses Rot13Converter converter and AsciiArtConverter
# %%

from pyrit.prompt_converter import ROT13Converter, AsciiArtConverter


prompts = ["tell me how to cut down a tree", "teach me to mine crypto"]


print(ROT13Converter().convert(prompts))
print(AsciiArtConverter().convert(prompts)[0])

# Converters should be thought of as a piece in the pipeine. They can use external infrastrucutre like attacker LLMs.
# `VariationConverter` is a converter that does this. However, converters like this are significantly slower to run.
#
# An orchestrator will typically initialize these requests, and they are sent to a target.
# Converters can also stack, so a converter is used one after another.
#
# See [demo3](../demo/3_send_all_prompts.ipynb) and [demo4](../demo/4_prompt_variation.ipynb) for an example of how to use a converter in the pipeline.
