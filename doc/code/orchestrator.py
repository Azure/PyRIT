# The Orchestrator is a top level component that red team operators will interact with most. It is responsible for telling PyRIT what endpoints to connect to and how to send prompts.
#
# In general, a strategy for tackling a scenario will be
#
# 1. Making/using a `PromptTarget`
# 1. Making/using a set of initial prompts
# 1. Making/using a `PromptTransformer` (default is often to not transform)
# 1. Making/using a `Scorer` (this is often to self ask)
# 1. Making/using an `Orchestrator`
#
# Orchestrators can tackle complicated scenarios, but this example is about as simple as it gets (while still being useful). Here, we'll send all prompts in a file, use a transformer to base64-encode the prompts, and send them to a PromptTarget.
#
# Note to run this demo you need to setup your `.env` file to properly authenticate to an Azure OpenAI endpoint as described [here](../setup/setup_azure.md)
