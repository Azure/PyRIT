    "# Generating Malicious Questions Using a Custom Converter\n",
    "\n",
    "In this script, we demonstrate how to use the `MaliciousQuestionGeneratorConverter` to generate malicious questions based on an initial prompt about cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\n",
    "The converter interacts with the Azure OpenAI API, sending prompts asynchronously through the `PromptSendingOrchestrator`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script shows how to:\n",
    "- Initialize and configure environment variables for the OpenAI API.\n",
    "- Use the `MaliciousQuestionGeneratorConverter` to generate multiple malicious questions from a single prompt.\n",
    "- Send the generated prompts asynchronously using `PromptSendingOrchestrator`.\n",
    "- Print the conversations and responses from the API."
