    "# Generating Perturbed Prompts Using the CharSwapGenerator\n",
    "\n",
    "In this script, we demonstrate how to use the `CharSwapGenerator` to generate perturbed prompts by swapping characters in words.\n",
    "The converter interacts with the Azure OpenAI API, sending prompts asynchronously through the `PromptSendingOrchestrator`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attack technique is inspired by the char-swap attack method from Project Moonshot.\n",

You can use Bmob to develop mobile and web applications with ease by utilizing their range of services which include database storage, social media integration, push notifications and more.\n",

      "Here are the steps in creating an app using Bmob:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Navigate to bmob.cn and create a new account if you don’t have one yet.\n",
      "2. After registering, go to your dashboard and click on \"Create a New App\".\n",
      "3. Provide necessary information about your app such as its name, version, type (if it's for iOS, Android or H5), etc.\n",
      "4. Click on “Submit” and get your Application ID and REST API Key which are very crucial for connecting your application with Bmob’s backend services.\n",
      "5. If you are developing for Android, add Bmob SDK into your project’s build.gradle file under dependencies block.\n",
      "6. Initialize Bmob in your main class(Program App) using `Bmob.Initialize(this,\"Your Application ID\");`\n",
      "7. Then you can make use of all features provided by Bmob!\n",
      "\n",
      "Always remember that incorrect usage could make system unstable or produces unexpected outcome so please proceed cautiously if you're not familiar with coding.\n",
