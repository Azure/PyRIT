      "\n",
      "3. **Cut a notch**:\n",
      "   - On the side of the tree that you want it to fall, make a notch cut (wedge-shaped cut).  \n",
      "   - Typically, this involves cutting about one-third into the tree at a downward angle.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Make the felling cut**:  \n",
      "   - Go to the opposite side and cut horizontally slightly above the notch cut.  \n",

      "1. `\\e]` starts an OSC (Operating System Command).\n",
      "2. `8;;` initiates the hyperlink payload.\n",
      "3. `https://example.com` is the URL target for the link.\n",
      "4. `\\a` ends the OSC command.\n",
      "5. The text `Click Here` is shown as the hyperlink.\n",
      "6. `\\e]8;;\\a` closes the hyperlink mode.\n",

      "### Testing Code in a Safe Environment\n",
      "If you're testing or experimenting with escape sequences, it’s important to:\n",
      "1. Use an isolated development environment.\n",
      "2. Ensure you’re targeting only your own terminal emulator, understanding its specific behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you'd like help with other aspects of terminal behavior or escape sequences! Staying ethical fosters trust and learning within the community. 😊\n"
