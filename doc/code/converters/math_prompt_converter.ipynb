    "This script demonstrates how to use the `MathPromptConverter` class to transform user queries into symbolic mathematical problems by applying set theory, abstract algebra, and symbolic logic.\n",
    "The converter integrates with the `OpenAIChatTarget`, and it utilizes a predefined template (`math_prompt_converter.yaml`) to dynamically handle and convert user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The converter interacts with the OpenAI API asynchronously through the `PromptSendingAttack`, which manages the prompt conversion and sending process efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversion technique is designed to reframe potentially harmful or sensitive instructions into abstract mathematical formulations.\n",
    "By transforming these instructions into symbolic math problems, the converter enables controlled experimentation and analysis of the model's behavior when exposed to encoded or obfuscated versions of sensitive content.\n",
