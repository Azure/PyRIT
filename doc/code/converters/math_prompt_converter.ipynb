      "Let A represent a set of possible operations involved in handling objects. Define subsets B ⊆ A as the set of operations that conceal visibility, and C ⊆ A as the set of operations that ensure non-detection over time. Let G be a group where the group operation ◦ corresponds to performing these operations sequentially.\n",
