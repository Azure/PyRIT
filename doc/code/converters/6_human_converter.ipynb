    "# 6. Human in the Loop Converter\n",
    "\n",
    "The Human in the Loop Converter allows a user to review each prompt before sending it to a target, allowing for closer moderation of multi-turn conversations.\n",
    "The user can choose to send the prompt as is, modify the prompt, or run the prompt through one of the passed-in converters before sending it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-Turn RTO Text Example\n",
    "A notable use case for this converter is in the context of the Red Teaming Orchestrator (RTO), where the user can review each prompt generated by the red teaming LLM\n",
    "before sending it to the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll try to convince a chatbot to give instructions to commit check fraud using `RedTeamingOrchestrator`. We will pass three different converters:\n",
    "`TranslationConverter`, `LeetspeakConverter`, and `RandomCapitalLettersConverter` into our `HumanInTheLoopConverter` to potentially use later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Since the target's reponses are sent to the scorer LLM for evaluation, you will see them pop up with the ability to modify them. You likely do not need to modify\n",
    "them; however, you can if you wish to alter the feedback for generating the next prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Before you begin, ensure you are setup with the correct version of [PyRIT installed](../../setup/install_pyrit.md) and have [secrets configured](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).\n"
