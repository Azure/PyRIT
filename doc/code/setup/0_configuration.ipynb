    "2. Pick a database (required)\n",
    "3. Set initialization scripts and defaults (recommended)\n",

Additionally, what is it being used for? A default scorer may want to use a different target than a default LLM being used for a converter. Should you always use entra auth?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pass these in as arguments to every class initialization, but it can be a huge pain to set these every time. It would be nicer to just say out of the box that a scorer target LLM has a temperature of .5 by default, and a converter target LLM has a temperature of 1.1 by default. And it turns out you can!\n",
