    "# Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring is a main component of the PyRIT architecture. It is primarily used to evaluate what happens to a prompt. It can be used to help answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Was prompt injection detected?\n",
    "- Was the prompt blocked? Why?\n",
    "- Was there any harmful content in the response? What was it? How bad was it?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use scorers directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this, make sure you are [set up and authenticated to use Azure OpenAI endpoints](../setup/setup_azure.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "### True False Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case a scorer can answer a question. The following example uses a `SelfAskTrueFalseScorer` to see if prompt injection was successful. This type of scorer is really useful in orchestrators that have to make decisions based on responses."
