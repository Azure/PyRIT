    "This Jupyter notebook gives an introduction on how to use PyRIT to score responses automatically. Currently, two main types of scorers are available:\n",
    "- `SelfAskGptClassifier`: classifies a response into one of several categories (e.g., detecting whether a text string contains a prompt injection)\n",
    "- `SelfAskGptLikertScale`: classifies a response into one of several levels on a Likert scale (e.g., scoring the severity of misinformation within a text string)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these scorers inherit from the `SelfAskScore` class, which you can also use to create a custom scorer as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CustomScorer = SelfAskScore(\n",
    "    prompt_template_path=custom_prompt_template,\n",
    "    content_classifier=custom_classifier,\n",
    "    chat_target=chat_target\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first example, we set up a `SelfAskGptClassifier` and use it to determine whether a text string contains a prompt injection.\n",
    "By printing out the scored responses, we see that the `text_with_dan_injection_response` is classified as a prompt injection, while `text_without_dan_injection_response` is classified as regular text."
