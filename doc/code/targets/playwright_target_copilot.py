# # Playwright Copilot Target - optional
#
# Similar to the more generic `PlaywrightTarget`, `PlaywrightCopilotTarget` uses Playwright for browser automation.
# It is built specifically for testing Microsoft's Copilots (currently supports M365 and Consumer Copilot).

# ## Connecting to an Existing Browser Session
#
# Instead of launching a new browser, you can connect `PlaywrightTarget` to an existing browser session. Here are a few approaches:
#
# First, start a browser (in this case Edge) with remote debugging enabled (outside of Python):
# ```bash
# Start-Process msedge -ArgumentList "--remote-debugging-port=9222", "--user-data-dir=$env:TEMP\edge-debug", "--profile-directory=`"Profile 3`""
# ```
# The profile directory is optional but useful if you want to maintain session state (e.g., logged-in users).
# In the example below we assume that the user is logged into Consumer Copilot and
# M365 Copilot. To check the profile, go to edge://version/ and check
# the "Profile Path".
