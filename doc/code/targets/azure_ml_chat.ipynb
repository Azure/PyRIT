    "\n",
    "1. **Obtain the API Key:**\n",
    "   - Navigate to the AML Studio.\n",
    "   - Go to the 'Endpoints' section.\n",
    "   - Retrieve the API key and endpoint URI.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Set the Environment Variable:**\n",
    "   - Add the obtained API key to an environment variable named `AZURE_ML_KEY`.\n",
    "   - Add the obtained endpoint URI to an environment variable named `AZURE_ML_MANAGED_ENDPOINT`.\n",

They define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be performed on the data. Examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.\n",
