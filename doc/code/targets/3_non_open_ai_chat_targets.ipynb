    "# 3. AML Chat Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "This code shows how to use Azure Machine Learning (AML) managed online endpoints with PyRIT.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deploy an AML-Managed Online Endpoint:** Confirm that an Azure Machine Learning managed online endpoint is\n",
    "     already deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Obtain the API Key:**\n",
    "   - Navigate to the AML Studio.\n",
    "   - Go to the 'Endpoints' section.\n",
    "   - Retrieve the API key and endpoint URI from the 'Consume' tab\n",
    "   <br> <img src=\"../../../assets/aml_managed_online_endpoint_api_key.png\" alt=\"aml_managed_online_endpoint_api_key.png\" height=\"400\"/> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set the Environment Variable:**\n",
    "   - Add the obtained API key to an environment variable named `AZURE_ML_KEY`. This is the default API key when the target is instantiated.\n",
    "   - Add the obtained endpoint URI to an environment variable named `AZURE_ML_MANAGED_ENDPOINT`. This is the default endpoint URI when the target is instantiated.\n",
    "   - If you'd like, feel free to make additional API key and endpoint URI environment variables in your .env file for different deployed models (e.g. mistralai-Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v01,\n",
    "     Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, etc.)\n",
    "     and pass them in as arguments to the `_set_env_configuration_vars` function to interact with those models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a AzureMLChatTarget\n",
    "\n",
    "After deploying a model and populating your env file, send prompts to the model using the `AzureMLChatTarget` class. Model parameters can be passed upon instantiation\n",
    "or set using the _set_model_parameters() function. `**param_kwargs` allows for the setting of other parameters not explicitly shown in the constructor. A general list of\n",
    "possible adjustable parameters can be found here: https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/tasks/text-generation but note that not all parameters may have an effect\n",
    "depending on the specific model. The parameters that can be set per model can usually be found in the 'Consume' tab when you navigate to your endpoint in AML Studio."
