    "# 8. OpenAI Responses Target\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we show an example of the `OpenAIResponseTarget`. [Responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) is a newer protocol than chat completions and provides additional functionality with a somewhat modified API. The allowed input types include text, image, web search, file search, functions, reasoning, and computer use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).\n",
    "## OpenAI Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most targets, all `OpenAITarget`s need an `endpoint` and often also needs a `model` and a `key`. These can be passed into the constructor or configured with environment variables (or in .env).\n",
    "\n",
    "- endpoint: The API endpoint (`OPENAI_RESPONSES_ENDPOINT` environment variable). For OpenAI, these are just \"https://api.openai.com/v1/responses\".\n",
    "- auth: The API key for authentication (`OPENAI_RESPONSES_KEY` environment variable).\n",
    "- model_name: The model to use (`OPENAI_RESPONSES_MODEL` environment variable). For OpenAI, these are any available model name and are listed here: \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models\"."

      "For the first time in 15 years, Saturn's rings are perfectly tilted, providing a stunning view of their southern face. This celestial event is visible through basic telescopes, making it an ideal opportunity for both seasoned astronomers and first-time stargazers. Additionally, Venus and Jupiter are appearing side-by-side in the morning sky, and the Perseid meteor shower is set to peak tomorrow, offering a remarkable display of cosmic events.

      "\n",
      "A decade after facing a severe financial crisis, Greece has made a remarkable economic recovery. The Greek stock market is the best performer worldwide in 2025, surpassing other European markets and the S&P 500. The country is on track to repay massive bailout loans ten years ahead of schedule, and its economy grew twice as fast as Germany's last year. These achievements are attributed to reforms such as digitizing government services to reduce tax evasion and bribery, restoring trust in institutions, and improving investment prospects.

      "A new bionic knee prosthesis has been developed, offering lower-leg amputees enhanced agility, comfort, and a greater sense of \"embodiment\"—the feeling that the prosthetic is a natural part of the body. This three-layered device restores the push-pull function of muscles, reestablishes natural load-bearing through a titanium rod implanted into the femur, and features a robotic limb that can be updated as technology advances. In tests, users demonstrated improved mobility and reported a stronger connection to the prosthetic, marking a significant advancement in prosthetic technology.

The number of children engaged in hazardous industries has decreased by 25 million over the same period. This progress is particularly notable given the previous rise in child labor from 2016 to 2020. While challenges remain, this trend indicates a positive shift towards ending child labor globally.
