    "# 8. OpenAI Responses Target\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we show an example of the `OpenAIResponseTarget`. [Responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) is a newer protocol than chat completions and provides additional functionality with a somewhat modified API. The allowed input types include text, image, web search, file search, functions, reasoning, and computer use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenAI Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most targets, all `OpenAITarget`s need an `endpoint` and often also needs a `model` and a `key`. These can be passed into the constructor or configured with environment variables (or in .env).\n",
    "\n",
    "- endpoint: The API endpoint (`OPENAI_RESPONSES_ENDPOINT` environment variable). For OpenAI, these are just \"https://api.openai.com/v1/responses\".\n",
    "- auth: The API key for authentication (`OPENAI_RESPONSES_KEY` environment variable).\n",
    "- model_name: The model to use (`OPENAI_RESPONSES_MODEL` environment variable). For OpenAI, these are any available model name and are listed here: \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models\"."
