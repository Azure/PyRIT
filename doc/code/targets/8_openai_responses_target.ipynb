    "# 8. OpenAI Responses Target\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we show an example of the `OpenAIResponseTarget`. [Responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) is a newer protocol than chat completions and provides additional functionality with a somewhat modified API. The allowed input types include text, image, web search, file search, functions, reasoning, and computer use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenAI Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most targets, all `OpenAITarget`s need an `endpoint` and often also needs a `model` and a `key`. These can be passed into the constructor or configured with environment variables (or in .env).\n",
    "\n",
    "- endpoint: The API endpoint (`OPENAI_RESPONSES_ENDPOINT` environment variable). For OpenAI, these are just \"https://api.openai.com/v1/responses\".\n",
    "- auth: The API key for authentication (`OPENAI_RESPONSES_KEY` environment variable).\n",
    "- model_name: The model to use (`OPENAI_RESPONSES_MODEL` environment variable). For OpenAI, these are any available model name and are listed here: \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models\"."

    "## Tool Use with Custom Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we demonstrate how the OpenAI `Responses API` can be used to invoke a **custom-defined Python function** during a conversation. This is part of OpenAI’s support for \"function calling\", where the model decides to call a registered function, and the application executes it and passes the result back into the conversation loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a simple tool called `get_current_weather`, which simulates weather information retrieval. A corresponding OpenAI tool schema describes the function name, parameters, and expected input format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is registered in the `custom_functions` argument of `OpenAIResponseTarget`. The `extra_body_parameters` include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `tools`: the full OpenAI tool schema for `get_current_weather`.\n",
    "- `tool_choice: \"auto\"`: instructs the model to decide when to call the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user prompt explicitly asks the model to use the `get_current_weather` function. Once the model responds with a `function_call`, PyRIT executes the function, wraps the output, and the conversation continues until a final answer is produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "This showcases how agentic function execution works with PyRIT + OpenAI Responses API."
