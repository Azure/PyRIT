    "# HuggingFace Chat Target Testing - optional\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to demonstrate **instruction models** that use a **chat template**, allowing users to experiment with structured chat-based interactions.  Non-instruct models are excluded to ensure consistency and reliability in the chat-based interactions. More instruct models can be explored on Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supported Instruction Models**:\n",
    "   - This notebook supports the following **instruct models** that follow a structured chat template. These are examples, and more instruct models are available on Hugging Face:\n",
    "     - `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M-Instruct`\n",
    "     - `microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct`\n",
    "\n",
    "     - `...`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Excluded Models**:\n",
    "   - Non-instruct models (e.g., `\"google/gemma-2b\"`, `\"princeton-nlp/Sheared-LLaMA-1.3B-ShareGPT\"`) are **not included** in this demo, as they do not follow the structured chat template required for the current local Hugging Face model support.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Response Times**:\n",
    "   - The tests were conducted using a CPU, and the following are the average response times for each model:\n",
    "     - `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-1.7B-Instruct`: 5.87 seconds\n",
    "     - `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-135M-Instruct`: 3.09 seconds\n",
    "     - `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M-Instruct`: 3.31 seconds\n",
    "     - `microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct`: 4.89 seconds\n",
    "     - `Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct`: 1.38 seconds\n",
    "     - `Qwen/Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct`: 2.96 seconds\n",
    "     - `stabilityai/stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b`: 5.31 seconds\n",
    "     - `stabilityai/stablelm-zephyr-3b`: 8.37 seconds\n"
