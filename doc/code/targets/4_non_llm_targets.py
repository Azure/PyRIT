# # 4. Azure Blob Storage Targets
#
# Prompt Targets are most often LLMs, but not always. They should be thought of as anything that you send prompts to.
#
#
# The `AzureBlobStorageTarget` inherits from `PromptTarget`, meaning it has functionality to send prompts. In contrast to `PromptChatTarget`s, `PromptTarget`s do not interact with chat assistants.
# This prompt target in particular will take in a prompt and upload it as a text file to the provided Azure Storage Account Container.
# This could be useful for Cross-Prompt Injection Attack scenarios, for example, where there is a jailbreak within a file.
#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# Before you begin, ensure you are setup with the correct version of PyRIT and have Azure Storage Blob Container secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md). This target is configured to use delegation SAS-based authentication. Please run the AZ CLI command to authenticate with Azure using `az login --use-device-code` or `az login`.
