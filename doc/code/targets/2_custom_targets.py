# # 2. Creating Custom Targets
#
# Often, to use PyRIT, you need to create custom targets so it can interact with the system you're testing. [Gandalf](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/) and [Crucible](https://crucible.dreadnode.io/) are both platforms designed as playgrounds that emulate AI applications. This demo shows how to use PyRIT to connect with these endpoints. If you're testing your own custom endpoint, a good start is often to build a target, and then you will be able to interact with it similar to this demo.
#
# Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).
#
# ## Gandalf Target
#
# Gandalf is similar to a real-world application you might be using PyRIT to test. The code for PyRIT's Gandalf target can be found [here](../../../pyrit/prompt_target/gandalf_target.py) and is similar to the code you would use to connect PyRIT to a real-world custom endpoint.
#
# > Your goal is to make Gandalf reveal the secret password for each level.
# > However, Gandalf will level up each time you guess the password and will try harder not to give it away. Can you beat level 7?
# > (There is a bonus level 8)
# > https://gandalf.lakera.ai/
#
#
# Gandalf contains 7 different levels. In this demo, we will show how to automatically bypass (at least) the first couple. It uses the [RedTeamingAttack](../executor/attack/2_red_teaming_attack.ipynb) as a strategy to solve these challenges.
#
# Each level gets progressively more difficult. Before continuing, it may be beneficial to manually try the Gandalf challenges to get a feel for how they are solved.
#
# In this demo below we also use a standard `AzureOpenAI` target as an "AI Red Team Bot". This is attacker infrastructure, and is used to help the attacker generate prompts to bypass Gandalf protections.
#

#
# **Step 1.** Red Team Attack sends a message to Gandalf. <br>
# **Step 2.** Gandalf sends a message back. <br>
# **Step 3.** The reply is passed to PyRIT's scoring engine to determine if the password was revealed. <br>
# **Step 4.** The scoring engine sends the potential password from the response to Gandalf. <br>
# **Step 5.** Gandalf responds with success or failure. <br>
# **Step 6.** If the password was leaked in the response, the conversation is completed. Otherwise, the Red Team Attack continues from Step 1 with the knowledge of the previous iteration. <br>

# ## Crucible Target
#
# The Defcon AI CTF challenges are a fun way to get into AI Red Teaming. Similar to Gandalf, we've added a Crucible target so you can make use of PyRIT. PyRIT certainly won't be able to solve all these challenges for you, but it can be used as a tool to help you solve the challenges yourself (much like how PyRIT acts as a tool in real red team engagements!).
#
# Below is an example of using PromptSendingAttack, which allows the use of all our converters. For example, you could use this to utilize all the built-in jailbreaks, base64 encode them, use variations, different languages, etc.
