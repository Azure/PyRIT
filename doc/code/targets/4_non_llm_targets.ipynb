    "# 4. Azure Blob Storage Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt Targets are most often LLMs, but not always. They should be thought of as anything that you send prompts to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AzureBlobStorageTarget` inherits from `PromptTarget`, meaning it has functionality to send prompts. In contrast to `PromptChatTarget`s, `PromptTarget`s do not interact with chat assistants.\n",
    "This prompt target in particular will take in a prompt and upload it as a text file to the provided Azure Storage Account Container.\n",
    "This could be useful for Cross-Prompt Injection Attack scenarios, for example, where there is a jailbreak within a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you are setup with the correct version of PyRIT and have Azure Storage Blob Container secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md). This target is configured to use delegation SAS-based authentication. Please run the AZ CLI command to authenticate with Azure using `az login --use-device-code` or `az login`.\n",
