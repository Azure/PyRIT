    "# 1. OpenAI Chat Target\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we show an example of the `OpenAIChatTarget`, which includes many openAI models including `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4`, and `gpt-3.5`. Internally, this is one of our most-used chat targets for our own infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will use the Jailbreak `SeedPrompt`. Although you can interact with the target directly using `PromptRequestResponse` objects, it is almost always better to use an orchestrator. The simplest orchestrator is the `PromptSendingOrchestrator`, which provides parallelization, access to converters and scoring, simpler calling methods, and error resiliency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md)."

    "All `OpenAITarget`s can communicate either to [Azure OpenAI (AOAI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction). By default, it uses Azure OpenAI (we are Microsoft funded after all!) but you can configure a target to use OpenAI by passing the `is_azure_target=False` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most targets, all `OpenAITarget`s need an `endpoint`, `deployment_name`, and `api_key`. These can be passed into the constructor or configured with environment variables (or in .env).\n",
    "\n",
    "- api_key: By default, these targets will use an API key configured within environment variables (or .env) to authenticate (`OPENAI_CHAT_KEY` for OpenAI and `AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_KEY` for AOAI).\n",
    "- endpoint: AOAI needs an endpoint URI from your deployment. For OpenAI, these are just \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\" and do not need to be configured by the user.\n",
    "- deployment_name: Azure Open AI needs this from your deployment. For OpenAI, these are any available model name and are listed here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models\n",
    "\n",
    "For AOAI, There is an option to use the DefaultAzureCredential for User Authentication as well, for all AOAI Chat Targets. When `use_aad_auth=True`, ensure the user has 'Cognitive Service OpenAI User' role assigned on the AOAI Resource and `az login` is used to authenticate with the correct identity.\n"
