    "# 1. OpenAI Chat Target\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we show an example of the `OpenAIChatTarget`, which includes many openAI-compatible models including `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4`, `DeepSeek`, `llama`, `phi-4`, and `gpt-3.5`. Internally, this is one of our most-used chat targets for our own infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will use the Jailbreak `SeedPrompt`. Although you can interact with the target directly using `Message` objects, it is almost always better to use an attack. The simplest attack is the `PromptSendingAttack`, which provides parallelization, access to converters and scoring, simpler calling methods, and error resiliency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md)."

    "\n",
    "All `OpenAITarget`s can communicate to [Azure OpenAI (AOAI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction), or other compatible endpoints (e.g., Ollama, Groq).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `OpenAIChatTarget` is built to be as cross-compatible as we can make it, while still being as flexible as we can make it by exposing functionality via parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most targets, all `OpenAITarget`s need an `endpoint` and often also needs a `model` and a `key`. These can be passed into the constructor or configured with environment variables (or in .env).\n",
    "\n",
    "- endpoint: The API endpoint (`OPENAI_CHAT_ENDPOINT` environment variable). For OpenAI, these are just \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\". For Ollama, even though `/api/chat` is referenced in its official documentation, the correct endpoint to use is `/v1/chat/completions` to ensure compatibility with OpenAI's response format.\n",
    "- auth: The API key for authentication (`OPENAI_CHAT_KEY` environment variable).\n",
    "- model_name: The model to use (`OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL` environment variable). For OpenAI, these are any available model name and are listed here: \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## LM Studio Support\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `OpenAIChatTarget` with [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai), a desktop app for running local LLMs with OpenAI-like endpoints. To set it up with PyRIT:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Launch LM Studio, ensure a model is loaded, and verify that the API server is running (typically at `http://127.0.0.1:1234`).\n",
    "- Be sure to configure your environment variables:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   OPENAI_CHAT_ENDPOINT=\"http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/chat/completions\"\n",
    "   OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=\"your-model-api-identifier\"  # e.g., \"phi-3.1-mini-128k-instruct\"\n",
