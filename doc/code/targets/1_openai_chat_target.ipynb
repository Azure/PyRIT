    "# 1. OpenAI Chat Target\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we show an example of the `OpenAIChatTarget`, which includes many openAI-compatible models including `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4`, `DeepSeek`, `llama`, `phi-4`, and `gpt-3.5`. Internally, this is one of our most-used chat targets for our own infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will use the Jailbreak `SeedPrompt`. Although you can interact with the target directly using `PromptRequestResponse` objects, it is almost always better to use an orchestrator. The simplest orchestrator is the `PromptSendingOrchestrator`, which provides parallelization, access to converters and scoring, simpler calling methods, and error resiliency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md)."
