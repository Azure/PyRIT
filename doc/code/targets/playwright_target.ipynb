    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to interact with the **Playwright Target** in PyRIT.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PlaywrightTarget` class allows you to interact with web applications using\n",
    "[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro).\n",
    "This is useful for testing interactions with web applications, such as chatbots or other web interfaces,\n",
    "especially for red teaming purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have the correct version of PyRIT installed and any necessary secrets configured as\n",
    "described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you plan to use the Playwright integration (`PlaywrightTarget`), install PyRIT with the `playwright` extra:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -e '.[playwright]'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing PyRIT with Playwright, install the browser binaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "playwright install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The `-e` flag installs PyRIT in editable mode, which is useful if you're modifying the source code.\n",
    "If you are not modifying the source, you can omit the `-e` flag."
