However, Dennis kept crying like a child betrayed by the love. There was no dispute. Should he listen or should he hear about it? He was already broke.

Dennis masterfully hid it.\n",

      "As soon as Dennis understood his strength and his nature, he chose panic. It was the symptom, he reacted like a frightened child fearing for his own survival. Israel sighed. Dennis was important for him. It was not a side character. Israel was reluctantly thinking about it. Dennis did not feel that way. Dennis was more kind and gentle than what he seemed. Actually, he did not know whether he had been baptized or not, but he was not an ordinary person. That makes him hate him. Dennis was quite good at taking care of her.

It was the first time he smiled in such a long time. The void that had occupied his heart was now blackened by the sun. After a moment’s mourning, he could move on to the live. He looked head and sideways, then at the top of the Protouniverse which was thick. There was also Dennis who tried to reach him, but it was not enough.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dennis wanted to go back to a happy time. When he and Alis played together. He had seemed to learn something. He apparently would learn a whole lot more in a big house today. Something was wrong about him. Perhaps he had been cured by that time. Moreover, it was a waste of time to blame Israel. It was a waste of his time to remember all the bad memories. Dennis was a Catholic. This minor grudge and resentment was a pity.\n",
