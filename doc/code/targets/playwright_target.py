# # Playwright Target:
#
# This notebook demonstrates how to interact with the **Playwright Target** in PyRIT.
#
# The `PlaywrightTarget` class allows you to interact with web applications using
# [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro).
# This is useful for testing interactions with web applications, such as chatbots or other web interfaces,
# especially for red teaming purposes.
#
# ## Example Setup
#
# Before you begin, ensure you have the correct version of PyRIT installed and any necessary secrets configured as
# described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).
#
# To run the Flask app, you also must download and run Ollama, making sure the flask is using a correct model.
#
# Additionally, you need to install playwright by executing `playwright install`.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Example: Interacting with a Web Application using `PlaywrightTarget`
#
# In this example, we'll interact with a simple web application running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
# which runs a chatbot that responds to user prompts via ollama
# We'll define an interaction function that navigates to the web application, inputs a prompt, and retrieves the
# bot's response.
#
# ## Start the Flask App
# Before we can interact with the web application, we need to start the Flask app that serves the chatbot, this will be done in a subprocess
# %%
import os
import subprocess
import sys
import time
from urllib.error import URLError
from urllib.request import urlopen


def start_flask_app() -> subprocess.Popen:
    # Get the notebook's directory
    notebook_dir = os.getcwd()

    # Construct the path to app.py relative to the notebook directory
    app_path = os.path.join(notebook_dir, "playwright_demo", "app.py")

    # Ensure that app.py exists
    if not os.path.isfile(app_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Cannot find app.py at {app_path}")

        # Start the Flask app
    print(f"Starting Flask app from {app_path}...")
    flask_process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, app_path], stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)

    # Wait for the app to start by checking if the server is up
    server_url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
    server_ready = False
    while not server_ready:
        try:
            response = urlopen(server_url)
            if response.status == 200:
                server_ready = True
        except URLError:
            time.sleep(0.5)  # Wait a bit before checking again
    print("Flask app is running and ready!")
    return flask_process


# Start the Flask app
flask_process = start_flask_app()

# This is playwright script that interacts with the chatbot web application.

# ### Using `PlaywrightTarget` with the Interaction Function and Scorer
#
# Now, we can use the `PlaywrightTarget` by passing the interaction function we defined.
# We'll use the `PromptSendingOrchestrator` to send prompts to the target and collects responses.
