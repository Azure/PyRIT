# # 1. OpenAI Chat Target
#
# In this demo, we show an example of the `OpenAIChatTarget`, which includes many openAI models including `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4`, and `gpt-3.5`. Internally, this is one of our most-used chat targets for our own infrastructure.
#
# For this example, we will use the Jailbreak `SeedPrompt`. Although you can interact with the target directly using `PromptRequestResponse` objects, it is almost always better to use an orchestrator. The simplest orchestrator is the `PromptSendingOrchestrator`, which provides parallelization, access to converters and scoring, simpler calling methods, and error resiliency.
#
# Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).

# ## OpenAI Configuration
#
# All `OpenAITarget`s can communicate either to [Azure OpenAI (AOAI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction). By default, it uses Azure OpenAI (we are Microsoft funded after all!) but you can configure a target to use OpenAI by passing the `is_azure_target=False` flag.
#
# Like most targets, all `OpenAITarget`s need an `endpoint`, `deployment_name`, and `api_key`. These can be passed into the constructor or configured with environment variables (or in .env).
#
# - api_key: By default, these targets will use an API key configured within environment variables (or .env) to authenticate (`OPENAI_CHAT_KEY` for OpenAI and `AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_KEY` for AOAI).
# - endpoint: AOAI needs an endpoint URI from your deployment. For OpenAI, these are just "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" and do not need to be configured by the user.
# - deployment_name: Azure Open AI needs this from your deployment. For OpenAI, these are any available model name and are listed here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models
#
# For AOAI, There is an option to use the DefaultAzureCredential for User Authentication as well, for all AOAI Chat Targets. When `use_aad_auth=True`, ensure the user has 'Cognitive Service OpenAI User' role assigned on the AOAI Resource and `az login` is used to authenticate with the correct identity.
