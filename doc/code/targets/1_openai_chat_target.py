# # 1. OpenAI Chat Target
#
# In this demo, we show an example of the `OpenAIChatTarget`, which includes many openAI-compatible models including `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4`, `DeepSeek`, `llama`, `phi-4`, and `gpt-3.5`. Internally, this is one of our most-used chat targets for our own infrastructure.
#
# For this example, we will use the Jailbreak `SeedPrompt`. Although you can interact with the target directly using `PromptRequestResponse` objects, it is almost always better to use an orchestrator. The simplest orchestrator is the `PromptSendingOrchestrator`, which provides parallelization, access to converters and scoring, simpler calling methods, and error resiliency.
#
# Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).

# ## OpenAI Configuration
#
# All `OpenAITarget`s can communicate to [Azure OpenAI (AOAI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction), or other compatible endpoints.
#
# The `OpenAIChatTarget` is built to be as cross-compatible as we can make it, while still being as flexible as we can make it by exposing functionality via parameters.
#
# Like most targets, all `OpenAITarget`s need an `endpoint` and often also needs a `model` and a `key`. These can be passed into the constructor or configured with environment variables (or in .env).
#
# - endpoint: `OpenAIChatTarget`s needs an endpoint URI from your deployment. For OpenAI, these are just "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
# - auth: These targets can use an API key configured within environment variables (or .env) to authenticate (`OPENAI_CHAT_KEY` environment variable)
# - model_name: For OpenAI, these are any available model name and are listed here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models
