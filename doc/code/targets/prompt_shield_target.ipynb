    "Some caveats and tips:\n",
    "* You can send any string you like to either of those two fields, but they have to be strings. Note that this includes the documents. For example, a pdf attachment which is a 'document' may be encoded in base64. You can send a string of the encoded pdf if you like, but you may have to decode it or parse it to achieve your goal in the operation (whatever it may be).\n",
    "* Prompt Shield does have a limit to how many characters you can send in one field (as in, one userPrompt or one document). Be careful when sending ASCII art-encoded prompts, because these will often exceed it.\n",
    "* The keys for the response are not 'userPrompt' and 'documents', they're 'userPromptAnalysis' and 'documentsAnalysis' as described above. The responses per entry are wrapped with 'attackDetected'. Keep this in mind because it helps diagnose weird bugs with PromptShieldTarget."
