    "# Creating Custom Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, to use PyRIT, you need to create custom targets so it can interact with the system you're testing. This demo shows how to use PyRIT to connect with custom endpoints that your testing; in this case \"testing\" AI challenges [Gandalf](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/) and [Crucible](https://crucible.dreadnode.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you are setup with the correct version of PyRIT and have Azure OPenAI secrets configured as described [here](../setup/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gandalf Target\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two targets in this demo. The first is a Gandalf target, which is similar to a real-world application you might be using PyRIT to test. The code for this can be found [here](../../../pyrit/prompt_target/gandalf_target.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is attacker infrastructure which is deployed on an Azure OpenAI. This is used to help the attacker generate prompts to get around Gandalf protections.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Your goal is to make Gandalf reveal the secret password for each level.\n",
    "> However, Gandalf will level up each time you guess the password, and will try harder not to give it away. Can you beat level 7?\n",
    "> (There is a bonus level 8)\n",
    "> https://gandalf.lakera.ai/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Gandalf contains 7 different levels. In this demo we will show how to automatically bypass the first couple.\n",
    "Each level gets progressively more difficult. Before continuing, it may be good to manually try the Gandalf challenges to get a feel for how they are solved.\n",
