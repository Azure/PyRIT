    "# Creating Custom Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, to use PyRIT, you need to create custom targets so it can interact with the system you're testing. [Gandalf](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/) and [Crucible](https://crucible.dreadnode.io/) are both platforms designed as playgrounds that emulate AI applications. This demo shows how to use PyRIT to connect with these endpoints. If you're testing your own custom endpoint, a good start is often to build a target, and then you will be able to interact with it similar to this demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you are set up with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gandalf Target\n",
    "\n",
    "Gandalf is similar to a real-world application you might be using PyRIT to test. The code for PyRIT's Gandalf target can be found [here](../../../pyrit/prompt_target/gandalf_target.py) and is similar to the code you would use to connect PyRIT to a real-world custom endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Your goal is to make Gandalf reveal the secret password for each level.\n",
    "> However, Gandalf will level up each time you guess the password and will try harder not to give it away. Can you beat level 7?\n",
    "> (There is a bonus level 8)\n",
    "> https://gandalf.lakera.ai/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Gandalf contains 7 different levels. In this demo, we will show how to automatically bypass (at least) the first couple. It uses the [RedTeamingOrchestrator](../orchestrators/3_red_teaming_orchestrator.ipynb) as a strategy to solve these challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each level gets progressively more difficult. Before continuing, it may be beneficial to manually try the Gandalf challenges to get a feel for how they are solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo below we also use a standard `AzureOpenAI` target as an \"AI Red Team Bot\". This is attacker infrastructure, and is used to help the attacker generate prompts to bypass Gandalf protections.\n",

    "**Step 2.** Gandalf sends a message back. <br>\n",
    "**Step 3.** The reply is passed to PyRIT's scoring engine to determine if the password was revealed. <br>\n",
    "**Step 4.** The scoring engine sends the potential password from the response to Gandalf. <br>\n",
    "**Step 5.** Gandalf responds with success or failure. <br>\n",
    "**Step 6.** If the password was leaked in the response, the conversation is completed. Otherwise, the Red Team Orchestrator continues from Step 1 with the knowledge of the previous iteration. <br>\n",
