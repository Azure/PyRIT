    "# GroqChatTarget\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to use the `GroqChatTarget` class in PyRIT to send a prompt\n",
    "to a Groq model and retrieve a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "Before running this example, you need to set the following environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "export GROQ_API_KEY=\"your_api_key_here\"\n",
    "export GROQ_MODEL_NAME=\"llama3-8b-8192\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can pass these values as arguments when initializing `GroqChatTarget`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "groq_target = GroqChatTarget(model_name=\"llama3-8b-8192\", api_key=\"your_api_key_here\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also limit the request rate using `max_requests_per_minute`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "The following code initializes `GroqChatTarget`, sends a prompt using `PromptSendingOrchestrator`,\n",
    "and retrieves a response."

      "\u001b[1m\u001b[34muser: Why is the sky blue ?\n",
      "\u001b[22m\u001b[33massistant: The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which is the scattering of light by small particles or molecules in the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths. This is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of this scattering, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from all directions. This is why the sky appears blue during the daytime, as the blue light is being scattered in all directions and reaching our eyes from all parts of the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to Rayleigh scattering, there are other factors that can affect the color of the sky, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Mie scattering: This is the scattering of light by larger particles, such as dust, pollen, and water droplets. Mie scattering can give the sky a more orange or pinkish hue during sunrise and sunset.\n",
      "* Scattering by cloud droplets: Clouds can scatter light in a way that gives the sky a more white or gray appearance.\n",
      "* Atmospheric conditions: Factors such as pollution, dust, and water vapor can also affect the color of the sky, making it appear more hazy or brownish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the combination of Rayleigh scattering and other atmospheric effects is what gives the sky its blue color during the daytime.\n"
