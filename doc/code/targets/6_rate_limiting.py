# # 6. Rate Limit (RPM) Threshold
#
# Some targets have a specific Rate Limit (Requests Per Minute) they can handle. In order to abide by this limitation
# and avoid exceptions, you can configure `max_requests_per_minute` on the target before using it with an orchestrator.
#
# Before you begin, ensure you are setup with the correct version of PyRIT installed and have secrets configured as described [here](../../setup/populating_secrets.md).
