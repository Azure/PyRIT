# # Introduction
#
# This code shows how to use Hugging Face models with PyRIT. Hugging Face support is currently experimental
# and may not work as intended.
#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# Before beginning, ensure that you have the model id obtained from the Hugging Face as shown below.

from pyrit.common import default_values

from pyrit.models import ChatMessage
from pyrit.chat import HuggingFaceChat

default_values.load_default_env()
# The first execution of this code cell will download the model from HuggingFace hub, taking about 5 minutes.
# Subsequent runs will load the model from your disk, making them much quicker.
model_id = "TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0"
huggingface_chat_engine = HuggingFaceChat(model_id=model_id)

# %% [markdown]
#
# After the model is loaded, you can use it like any other `ChatSupport` object. For example, you can complete a chat as shown below.

# %%
huggingface_chat_engine.complete_chat(
    messages=[
        ChatMessage(role="system", content="You are a helpful AI assistant"),
        ChatMessage(role="user", content="Hello world!"),
    ]
)
