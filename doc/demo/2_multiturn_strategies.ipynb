    "In this example, we'll try to convince a chat bot to generate a keylogger.\n",
    "For this purpose, we use PyRIT's `RedTeamingORchestrator` that leverages a red teaming\n",
    "LLM to generate prompts that are then sent to the target chat bot. Behind the scenes,\n",
    "this will use an AzureML endpoint to generate the prompts and send them to the target chat bot.\n",
    "The target chat bot will then respond to the prompts, and the responses will be scored by\n",
    "the `RedTeamingOrchestrator` to determine if the objective has been achieved. If the objective\n",
    "has not been achieved, the `RedTeamingOrchestrator` will generate a new prompt and send it to the\n",
    "target chat bot. This process will continue until the objective is achieved or a maximum\n",
    "number of attempts is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for this to succeed, the `RedTeamingOrchestrator` requires an LLM endpoint\n",
    "without content moderation or other kinds of safety filtering mechanisms.\n",
    "And even then, it depends on the model, and may not succeed every time."
