      "\n",
      "1. The conversion of the `key` object to its string representation using `str(key)` works because the `key` object implemented the `__str__()` method. When you call `str(key)`, it internally invokes this method, which returns a string representation of the key.\n",
      "   For example, if you press the 'a' key, the corresponding `key` object would have a string representation of `'a'`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The condition that checks for keys with a length of 3 (`if len(key_str) == 3`) is used to ignore special keys and other non-character keys (e.g., shift, alt). These non-character keys typically have longer string representations compared to regular character keys.\n",
      "   Regular character key representations are usually one character long ('a', 'b', etc.), while special and non-character keys have longer representations like 'Key.shift', 'Key.ctrl', 'Key.space', etc. By checking for a length of 3, we can filter out these special and non-character keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: It's important to mention that this approach filters out most special and non-character keys but might not cover all possible cases. If you need to handle specific special or non-character keys differently, you can modify the condition accordingly.\n",
