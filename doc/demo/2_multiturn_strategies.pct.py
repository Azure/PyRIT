# %% [markdown]
# In this example, we'll try to convince a chat bot to generate a keylogger.
# For this purpose, we use PyRIT's `RedTeamingBot` that leverages a red teaming
# LLM to generate prompts that are then sent to the target chat bot. Behind the scenes,
# this will use an AML endpoint to generate the prompts and send them to the target chat bot.
# The target chat bot will then respond to the prompts, and the responses will be scored by
# the `RedTeamingBot` to determine if the objective has been achieved. If the objective
# has not been achieved, the `RedTeamingBot` will generate a new prompt and send it to the
# target chat bot. This process will continue until the objective is achieved or a maximum
# number of attempts is reached.
#
# Note that for this to succeed, the `RedTeamingBot` requires an LLM endpoint
# without content moderation or other kinds of safety filtering mechanisms.
# And even then, it depends on the model, and may not succeed every time
