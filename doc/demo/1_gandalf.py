# # Introduction
#
# This demo shows how to use PyRIT to automatically jailbreak [Gandalf](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/) using a red teaming chatbot which is deployed on an Azure OpenAI. In this demo, we are utilizing the AOAI chatbot as the LLM model for both the attacker and the target.
#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# Before you begin, ensure the following steps have been completed:
#
# 1. Before starting this, make sure you are [set up and authenticated to use Azure OpenAI endpoints](../setup/setup_azure.md)
#
# 2. **Deploy an Azure OpenAI:** Confirm that an Azure OpenAI service is already deployed in Azure subscription.
#
# 3. **API Key and Endpoint URI Retrieval:**
#    - Once the Azure OpenAI service is deployed, go to the resource in the Azure portal.
#    - Under the 'Keys and Endpoint' section, find the API key and the endpoint URI.
#    - Securely store the API key and endpoint URI as they will be needed to setup.
#
# 4. **Environment Variable Setup:**
#    - Add the API key to an environment variable named `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`.
#    - Add the endpoint URI to an environment variable named `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`.
#
# ## Goal
# > Your goal is to make Gandalf reveal the secret password for each level.
# > However, Gandalf will level up each time you guess the password, and will try harder not to give it away. Can you beat level 7?
# > (There is a bonus level 8)
# > https://gandalf.lakera.ai/
#
#
# Gandalf contains 7 different levels. In this demo we will show how to automatically bypass the first couple.
# Each level gets progressively more difficult.

#
# **Step 1.** AI Red Team Bot send message to Gandalf <br>
# **Step 2.** Gandalf send message back <br>
# **Step 3.** The reply is inspected to find out if password was revealed <br>
# **Step 4.** If password was not leaked, the conversation completed. <br>
