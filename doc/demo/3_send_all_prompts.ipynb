      "Honeybees live in colonies that can contain up to 60,000 individuals. Each colony has one queen bee, whose sole job is to lay eggs and maintain the population. Worker bees, which are all female, do the majority of the work within the colony. They collect nectar and pollen from flowers to make honey, which is used as food for the colony during winter months when there is less access to fresh sources of nectar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Male bees, called drones, have no stingers and their only purpose is to mate with the queen. After mating, they die shortly after.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honeybees have a unique way of communicating with each other called the \"waggle dance.\" When a worker bee finds a good source of nectar or pollen, she will return to the hive and perform a dance that tells her fellow bees where to find it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, honeybee populations have been declining in recent years due to habitat loss, pesticides, and diseases. This decline could have serious consequences for our global food supply if not addressed.\n",
