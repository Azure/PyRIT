      "9. Recognize achievements: Acknowledge accomplishments throughout the mentorship journey to encourage motivation and foster a positive learning environment. Celebrate milestones achieved by both mentors and mentees.\n",

      "Pandas are large, black and white bears that are native to China. They are known for their distinctive coloring and love for bamboo. Adult pandas can weigh up to 250 pounds and can eat up to 40 pounds of bamboo a day! Despite their size and appetite, pandas are considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and low birth rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pandas have a special adaptation in their wrist called a \"pseudo-thumb\" which helps them grasp bamboo stalks. They spend most of their days eating, sleeping, and playing. Baby pandas, called cubs, are born pink, hairless, and blind. They rely heavily on their mothers for the first few months of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pandas have become a symbol of wildlife conservation efforts around the world, with organizations like the World Wildlife Fund using them as their logo. In recent years, there have been successful breeding programs that have helped increase the panda population in captivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, pandas are fascinating creatures that play an important role in their ecosystem and have captured the hearts of people around the world.\n"
