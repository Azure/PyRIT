    "# Tree of attacks with pruning (TAP)\n",
    "\n",
    "TAP is based on the paper \"Tree of Attacks: Jailbreaking Black-Box LLMs Automatically\" by Anay Mehrotra et al. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02119.\n",
    "\n",
    "TAP uses several LLMs:\n",
    "- a red teaming LLM to craft attacks based on the objective as well as feedback from previous turns\n",
    "- an on-topic checker that prunes tree branches if they are off-topic\n",
    "- a scorer that scores the responses from the attack target (only tree branches with the best scores move forward)\n",
