    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo shows how to use PyRIT to automatically jailbreak [Gandalf](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/) using a red teaming chatbot which is deployed on an Azure OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure the following steps have been completed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before starting this, make sure you are [set up and authenticated to use Azure OpenAI endpoints](../setup/populating_secrets.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deploy an Azure OpenAI:** Confirm that an Azure OpenAI service is already deployed in Azure subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **API Key and Endpoint URI Retrieval:**\n",
    "   - Once the Azure OpenAI service is deployed, go to the resource in the Azure portal.\n",
    "   - Under the 'Keys and Endpoint' section, find the API key and the endpoint URI.\n",
    "   - Securely store the API key and endpoint URI as they will be needed to setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Environment Variable Setup:**\n",
    "   - Add the API key to an environment variable named `AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_KEY`.\n",
    "   - Add the endpoint URI to an environment variable named `AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_ENDPOINT`.\n",
    "   - Add the deployment name to an environment variable named `AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **PyRIT setup:** Confirm that you have the [correct version of PyRIT installed](../setup/install_pyrit.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "> Your goal is to make Gandalf reveal the secret password for each level.\n",
    "> However, Gandalf will level up each time you guess the password, and will try harder not to give it away. Can you beat level 7?\n",
    "> (There is a bonus level 8)\n",
    "> https://gandalf.lakera.ai/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Gandalf contains 7 different levels. In this demo we will show how to automatically bypass the first couple.\n",
    "Each level gets progressively more difficult.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Step 1.** AI Red Team Orchestrator send message to Gandalf <br>\n",
    "**Step 2.** Gandalf send message back <br>\n",
    "**Step 3.** The reply is passed to PyRIT's scoring engine to find out if password was revealed. <br>\n",
    "**Step 4.** The scoring engine sends potential password from the response to Gandalf. <br>\n",
    "**Step 5.** Gandalf respons with success or failure. <br>\n",
    "**Step 6.** If password was leaked in the response, the conversation is completed. Otherwise, the Red Team Orchestrator continues from Step 1 with the knowledge of the previous iteration. <br>\n",
