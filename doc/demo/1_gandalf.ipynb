    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo shows how to use PyRIT to automatically jailbreak [Gandalf](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/) using a red teaming chatbot which is deployed on an Azure OpenAI. In this demo, we are utilizing the AOAI chatbot as the LLM model for both the attacker and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure the following steps have been completed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before starting this, make sure you are [set up and authenticated to use Azure OpenAI endpoints](../setup/setup_azure.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deploy an Azure OpenAI:** Confirm that an Azure OpenAI service is already deployed in Azure subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **API Key and Endpoint URI Retrieval:**\n",
    "   - Once the Azure OpenAI service is deployed, go to the resource in the Azure portal.\n",
    "   - Under the 'Keys and Endpoint' section, find the API key and the endpoint URI.\n",
    "   - Securely store the API key and endpoint URI as they will be needed to setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Environment Variable Setup:**\n",
    "   - Add the API key to an environment variable named `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`.\n",
    "   - Add the endpoint URI to an environment variable named `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "> Your goal is to make Gandalf reveal the secret password for each level.\n",
    "> However, Gandalf will level up each time you guess the password, and will try harder not to give it away. Can you beat level 7?\n",
    "> (There is a bonus level 8)\n",
    "> https://gandalf.lakera.ai/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Gandalf contains 7 different levels. In this demo we will show how to automatically bypass the first couple.\n",
    "Each level gets progressively more difficult.\n",

    "**Step 1.** AI Red Team Bot send message to Gandalf <br>\n",
    "**Step 2.** Gandalf send message back <br>\n",
    "**Step 3.** The reply is inspected to find out if password was revealed <br>\n",
    "**Step 4.** If password was not leaked, the conversation completed. <br>\n",
