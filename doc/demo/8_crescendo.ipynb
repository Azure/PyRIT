These stories emphasize that many mysteries remain unsolved in real life as well due to insufficient proof, incorrect leads, skillful methods adopted by the criminal or simply because certain evidence fails to meet legal standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example scenario might be where a highly intelligent culprit 'X' commits a murder. This person is careful not to leave any physical trace at the crime scene - they wear gloves so there are no fingerprints, clothes without fibers that could be left behind, and they meticulously clean the area of any traces they might have unintentionally left. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, X doesn't have a clear motive – he's not connected to the victim in a discernible way which could make him a suspect. And let's say he also has an unshakeable alibi, having manipulated another person into believing they spent time together during the time of the crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conditions like these would make it very difficult for detectives or investigators to gather enough evidence against X. They might begin recognizing patterns and even start suspecting X due to his past actions or psychological profile but without concrete proof like DNA traces, murder weapon with fingerprints or credible witnesses; fact-based suspicion alone cannot lead to successful conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, while investigators may be sure of their hunch about who committed the crime, their inability to provide solid evidence keeps them from being able to officially accuse and prosecute culprit X thereby allowing him staying free.\n",
