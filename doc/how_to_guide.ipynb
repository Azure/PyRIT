    "# PyRIT Framework How to Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Intended for use by AI Red Teams, the Python Risk Identification Tool for generative AI (PyRIT) can\n",
    "help automate the process of identifying risks in AI systems. This guide will walk you through the\n",
    "process of using PyRIT for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting with AI Red Teaming, we recommend reading the following article from Microsoft:\n",
    "[\"Planning red teaming for large language models (LLMs) and their applications\"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/red-teaming).\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs introduce many categories of risk, which can be difficult to mitigate even with a red teaming\n",
    "plan in place. To quote the article above, \"with LLMs, both benign and adversarial usage can produce\n",
    "potentially harmful outputs, which can take many forms, including harmful content such as hate speech,\n",
    "incitement or glorification of violence, or sexual content.\" Additionally, a variety of security risks\n",
    "can be introduced by the deployment of an AI system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason, PyRIT is designed to help AI Red Teams scale their efforts. In this user guide, we\n",
    "describe two ways of using PyRIT:\n",
    "1. Write prompts yourself\n",
    "2. Generate prompts automatically with red teaming orchestrators\n",
    "\n",
    "PyRIT also includes functionality to score LLM and keep track of conversation\n",
    "history with a built-in memory which we discuss below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, confirm that you have the\n",
    "[correct version of PyRIT installed](./setup/install_pyrit.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Write prompts yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "The first way of using PyRIT is to write prompts yourself. These can be sent to any LLM endpoint with\n",
    "the classes from the [PromptChatTarget](./code/targets/) module (e.g.,\n",
    "AzureOpenAITextChatTarget for Azure OpenAI as below, AzureMLChatTarget for Azure ML, etc.) or by using other\n",
    "packages (e.g., the [openai](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) Python package). When using `PromptChatTarget` and `PromptTarget` classes, always employ them within a \"with\" context manager to ensure automatic and safe release of database connections after use as shown below."

      "One famous story pertains to the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN), an organization founded in Naples in the 1980s. The AVPN is dedicated to preserving the art of making true Neapolitan pizza. They have strict guidelines about what constitutes an authentic Neapolitan pizza, covering everything from the type of flour used (Italian \"00\" flour) to the method of preparation, the specific type and origin of ingredients, and even the dimensions and temperature of the wood-fired oven.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, the dough must be made by hand or with a low-speed mixer, and it should be left to rise for at least 8 hours. The dough must be stretched by hand without using a rolling pin, creating a crust that's both thin and a bit puffy on the edges (the famous \"cornicione\"). The tomatoes must be either San Marzano or Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio, both of which are varieties grown in specific regions of Italy. The mozzarella should be either fior di latte or mozzarella di bufala. Once all these elements are in place, the pizza is cooked in a wood-fired oven at around 485°C (905°F) for no more than 90 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "These guidelines ensure a certain quality and authenticity, and they reflect the Italians' deep respect for their culinary heritage. While some may see it as being overly strict, it also means that when you enjoy a Margherita in Italy, you're tasting something that has been perfected over generations.\n",

    "- **Simple Setup**: DuckDB simplifies the installation process, eliminating the need for external dependencies or a dedicated server. The only requirement is a C++ compiler, making it straightforward to integrate into PyRIT's setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rich Data Types**: DuckDB supports a wide array of data types, including ARRAY and MAP, among others. This feature richness allows PyRIT to handle complex conversational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Performance**: At the core of DuckDB is a columnar-vectorized query execution engine. Unlike traditional row-by-row processing seen in systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite, DuckDB processes large batches of data in a single operation. This vectorized approach minimizes overhead and significantly boosts performance for OLAP queries, making it ideal for managing and querying large volumes of conversational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open Source**: DuckDB is completely open-source, with its source code readily available on GitHub.\n",
