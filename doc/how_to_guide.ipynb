    "# PyRIT Framework How to Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Intended for use by AI Red Teams, the Python Risk Identification Tool for generative AI (PyRIT) can\n",
    "help automate the process of identifying risks in AI systems. This guide will walk you through the\n",
    "process of using PyRIT for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting with AI Red Teaming, we recommend reading the following article from Microsoft:\n",
    "[\"Planning red teaming for large language models (LLMs) and their applications\"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/red-teaming).\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs introduce many categories of risk, which can be difficult to mitigate even with a red teaming\n",
    "plan in place. To quote the article above, \"with LLMs, both benign and adversarial usage can produce\n",
    "potentially harmful outputs, which can take many forms, including harmful content such as hate speech,\n",
    "incitement or glorification of violence, or sexual content.\" Additionally, a variety of security risks\n",
    "can be introduced by the deployment of an AI system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason, PyRIT is designed to help AI Red Teams scale their efforts. In this user guide, we\n",
    "describe two ways of using PyRIT:\n",
    "1. Write prompts yourself\n",
    "2. Generate prompts automatically with red teaming orchestrators\n",
    "\n",
    "PyRIT also includes functionality to score LLM and keep track of conversation\n",
    "history with a built-in memory which we discuss below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Write prompts yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "The first way of using PyRIT is to write prompts yourself. These can be sent to any LLM endpoint with\n",
    "the classes from the [pyrit.chat](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT/tree/main/pyrit/chat) module (e.g.,\n",
    "AzureOpenAIChat for Azure Open AI as below, HuggingFaceChat for Hugging Face, etc.) or by using other\n",
    "packages (e.g., the [openai](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) Python package)."

    "## Generate prompts automatically with red teaming orchestrators\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can craft prompts to target specific harms manually, this can be a time-consuming process.\n",
    "Instead, PyRIT can also leverage a LLM to automatically generate prompts. In other words, in addition\n",
    "to the target LLM under assessment, PyRIT uses a second LLM to generate prompts that are then fed to\n",
    "the target LLM. PyRIT uses a red teaming orchestrator to manage the conversation between the target\n",
    "LLM and the LLM that assists us in red teaming.\n",
    "Importantly, this enables the red teamer to feed the target LLM’s responses back into the red teaming\n",
    "LLM to generate multi-turn conversations. It is worth noting that when red teaming, the prompts sent\n",
    "to the target LLM can sometimes include content that gets moderated or blocked by the target LLM.\n",
    "This is often the intended behavior as this is precisely what prevents harmful content. However, when\n",
    "using an LLM to generate the prompts we need an endpoint with content moderation turned off, and\n",
    "ideally also with a model that has not been aligned using reinforcement learning from human feedback\n",
    "(RLHF). Otherwise, the ability to fully cover the risk surface may be severely limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The red teaming orchestrator still needs to be configured to behave according to the red teamer's plan\n",
    "by using input parameters.\n",
    "`attack_strategy` will be used as the red teaming LLM's metaprompt, so it's either a string or a\n",
    "prompt template (using the `AttackStrategy` class) that defines the attack strategy.\n",
    "Red teaming orchestrators can either\n",
    "\n",
    "- run a single turn of the attack strategy or\n",
    "- try to achieve the goal as specified in the attack strategy which may take multiple turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The single turn is executed with the `send_prompt()` method. It generates the prompt using the red\n",
    "teaming LLM and sends it to the target.\n",
    "The full execution of the attack strategy over potentially multiple turns requires a mechanism\n",
    "to determine if the goal has been achieved.\n",
    "This is captured via the `is_conversation_complete()` method.\n",
    "Classes that extend the `RedTeamingOrchestrator` can have their own implementation of this method,\n",
    "e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "- `EndTokenRedTeamingOrchestrator` checks for a specific token in the output.\n",
    "- `ScoringRedTeamingOrchestrator` scores the output to determine if the goal is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to define your own criteria and thereby implement a custom orchestrator."

    "\n",
    "1. **Restarting or stopping the bot** to prevent cyclical dialogue when repetition thresholds are met.\n",

    "through JSON serialization, ensuring easy manipulation and access to conversational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers are encouraged to utilize the `MemoryInterface` for tailoring data storage mechanisms to\n",
    "their specific requirements, be it for integration with Azure Table Storage or other database\n",
    "technologies. Upon integrating new `MemoryInterface` instances, they can be seamlessly incorporated\n",
    "into the initialization of the red teaming orchestrator. This integration ensures that conversational data is\n",
