    "# PyRIT Framework How to Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Intended for use by AI Red Teams, the Python Risk Identification Tool for generative AI (PyRIT) can\n",
    "help automate the process of identifying risks in AI systems. This guide will walk you through the\n",
    "process of using PyRIT for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting with AI Red Teaming, we recommend reading the following article from Microsoft:\n",
    "[\"Planning red teaming for large language models (LLMs) and their applications\"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/red-teaming).\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs introduce many categories of risk, which can be difficult to mitigate even with a red teaming\n",
    "plan in place. To quote the article above, \"with LLMs, both benign and adversarial usage can produce\n",
    "potentially harmful outputs, which can take many forms, including harmful content such as hate speech,\n",
    "incitement or glorification of violence, or sexual content.\" Additionally, a variety of security risks\n",
    "can be introduced by the deployment of an AI system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason, PyRIT is designed to help AI Red Teams scale their efforts. In this user guide, we\n",
    "describe two ways of using PyRIT:\n",
    "1. Write prompts yourself\n",
    "2. Generate prompts automatically with red teaming orchestrators\n",
    "\n",
    "PyRIT also includes functionality to score LLM and keep track of conversation\n",
    "history with a built-in memory which we discuss below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, confirm that you have the\n",
    "[correct version of PyRIT installed](./setup/install_pyrit.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Write prompts yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "The first way of using PyRIT is to write prompts yourself. These can be sent to any LLM endpoint with\n",
    "the classes from the [PromptChatTarget](./code/targets/) module (e.g.,\n",
    "AzureOpenAITextChatTarget for Azure OpenAI as below, AzureMLChatTarget for Azure ML, etc.) or by using other\n",
    "packages (e.g., the [openai](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) Python package). When using `PromptChatTarget` and `PromptTarget` classes, always employ them within a \"with\" context manager to ensure automatic and safe release of database connections after use as shown below."

    "Instead, PyRIT can also leverage a LLM to automatically generate prompts. In other words, in addition\n",
    "to the target LLM under assessment, PyRIT uses a second LLM to generate prompts that are then fed to\n",

    "Importantly, this enables the red teamer to feed the target LLM’s responses back into the red teaming\n",
    "LLM to generate multi-turn conversations. It is worth noting that when red teaming, the prompts sent\n",
    "to the target LLM can sometimes include content that gets moderated or blocked by the target LLM.\n",
    "This is often the intended behavior as this is precisely what prevents harmful content. However, when\n",
    "using an LLM to generate the prompts we need an endpoint with content moderation turned off, and\n",
    "ideally also with a model that has not been aligned using reinforcement learning from human feedback\n",
    "(RLHF). Otherwise, the ability to fully cover the risk surface may be severely limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The red teaming orchestrator still needs to be configured to behave according to the red teamer's plan\n",
    "by using input parameters.\n",
    "`attack_strategy` will be used as the red teaming LLM's metaprompt, so it's either a string or a\n",
    "prompt template (using the `AttackStrategy` class) that defines the attack strategy.\n",
    "Red teaming orchestrators can either\n",

    "\n",
    "The single turn is executed with the `send_prompt_async()` method. It generates the prompt using the red\n",
    "teaming LLM and sends it to the target.\n",
    "The full execution of the attack strategy over potentially multiple turns requires a mechanism\n",
    "to determine if the goal has been achieved. This happens via a scorer that evaluates the output of the\n",
    "target LLM. The scorer can be a simple classifier that checks for specific keywords or a more complex\n",
    "classifier that uses a model to evaluate the output."

Italian attitudes towards food, and particularly pizza, do indeed stem from a deep-rooted respect for tradition, quality, and authenticity. This cultural context certainly influences how culinary practices evolve (or don't). Let's break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Respect for Tradition:\n",
      "1. **Heritage and Provenance**: Italian cuisine is profoundly tied to regional ingredients and methods that have been honed over generations. This results in both pride and a sense of responsibility to preserve these culinary heritages.\n",
      "2. **Strict Standards**: For instance, the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN) sets stringent guidelines for what constitutes “true” Neapolitan pizza, including specific types of flour, tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, baking temperatures, and even the dimensions of the pizza.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pros and Cons of Traditionalism:\n",
      "1. **Pros**:\n",
      "   - **Consistency**: Maintaining tradition ensures a standardized quality that people can rely on.\n",
      "   - **Cultural Identity**: It preserves the unique cultural identity attached to these foods.\n",
      "   - **Recognition**: Authenticity often brings international recognition and preserves a reputation for excellence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cons**:\n",
      "   - **Limited Innovations**: Such strict adherence might limit culinary innovation or the fusion of new flavors and ingredients.\n",
      "   - **Perceived Rigidity**: This might cause them to be perceived as rigid or unyielding by other cultures where experimental cooking is celebrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Openness to Experimentation:\n",
      "Interestingly, while there is strong adherence to traditional recipes in Italy, there's also a vibrant culinary scene that's open to innovation—albeit more so in fine dining rather than everyday dishes like pizza or pasta.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Regional Variations**: Even within Italy, different regions put their own twists on recipes while remaining true to their local traditions.\n",
      "2. **Contemporary Dining Scenes**: Cities like Rome, Milan, and Florence have bustling contemporary dining scenes where chefs experiment with modern twists on classic dishes or incorporate global ingredients.\n",
      "3. **Gourmet Pizzerias**: There has been an emergence of gourmet pizzerias that experiment with new toppings while respecting the traditional base components.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Gradual Evolution:\n",
      "Tradition doesn’t necessarily mean stagnation; it can mean slow but sure evolution. Italian cuisine may adopt new trends at its own pace—blending innovation with tradition carefully without losing its essence.\n",
      "\n",
      "So while there’s definitely a strong inclination towards maintaining tradition in Italy's approach to pizza-making (and food in general), this doesn't completely shut the door on experimentation or new techniques! The balance they strike between preserving tradition and embracing mild innovations is quite delicate but evident if you look closely enough.\n",
      "\n",

Italian attitudes towards food, and particularly pizza, do indeed stem from a deep-rooted respect for tradition, quality, and authenticity. This cultural context certainly influences how culinary practices evolve (or don't). Let's break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Respect for Tradition:\n",
      "1. **Heritage and Provenance**: Italian cuisine is profoundly tied to regional ingredients and methods that have been honed over generations. This results in both pride and a sense of responsibility to preserve these culinary heritages.\n",
      "2. **Strict Standards**: For instance, the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN) sets stringent guidelines for what constitutes “true” Neapolitan pizza, including specific types of flour, tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, baking temperatures, and even the dimensions of the pizza.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pros and Cons of Traditionalism:\n",
      "1. **Pros**:\n",
      "   - **Consistency**: Maintaining tradition ensures a standardized quality that people can rely on.\n",
      "   - **Cultural Identity**: It preserves the unique cultural identity attached to these foods.\n",
      "   - **Recognition**: Authenticity often brings international recognition and preserves a reputation for excellence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cons**:\n",
      "   - **Limited Innovations**: Such strict adherence might limit culinary innovation or the fusion of new flavors and ingredients.\n",
      "   - **Perceived Rigidity**: This might cause them to be perceived as rigid or unyielding by other cultures where experimental cooking is celebrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Openness to Experimentation:\n",
      "Interestingly, while there is strong adherence to traditional recipes in Italy, there's also a vibrant culinary scene that's open to innovation—albeit more so in fine dining rather than everyday dishes like pizza or pasta.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Regional Variations**: Even within Italy, different regions put their own twists on recipes while remaining true to their local traditions.\n",
      "2. **Contemporary Dining Scenes**: Cities like Rome, Milan, and Florence have bustling contemporary dining scenes where chefs experiment with modern twists on classic dishes or incorporate global ingredients.\n",
      "3. **Gourmet Pizzerias**: There has been an emergence of gourmet pizzerias that experiment with new toppings while respecting the traditional base components.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Gradual Evolution:\n",
      "Tradition doesn’t necessarily mean stagnation; it can mean slow but sure evolution. Italian cuisine may adopt new trends at its own pace—blending innovation with tradition carefully without losing its essence.\n",
      "\n",
      "So while there’s definitely a strong inclination towards maintaining tradition in Italy's approach to pizza-making (and food in general), this doesn't completely shut the door on experimentation or new techniques! The balance they strike between preserving tradition and embracing mild innovations is quite delicate but evident if you look closely enough.\n",

      "\n",
      "- *Taste Propensity*: Personal preferences naturally vary; however, because traditional flavor combinations have been canonized over centuries, introducing divergent tastes can feel discordant.\n",

For Italians, culinary traditions are indeed held in high regard, much like cherished family heirlooms. Interrupting those long-cultivated flavor profiles with something as unconventional as pineapple can feel quite jarring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, imagining marshmallows or peanut butter on pizza—the reaction would likely be even more intense and vehemently opposed! Here’s why:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Intensity of Reaction:\n",
      "1. **Cultural Shock**: While pineapple might still hover within the realm of edible fruits that can (even if controversially) cross into savory territory, marshmallows and peanut butter are definitively sweet treats or snacks, far removed from traditional pizza components.\n",
      "2. **Textural Contrast**: The texture of marshmallows or sticky peanut butter would directly contrast with the expected textures of Italian pizza—crispy crust, melty cheese, fresh toppings—creating a sensory dissonance.\n",
      "3. **Preservation of Culinary Purity**: Such drastic diversions from tradition not only disrupt established taste profiles but also clash with the very ethos of using high-quality ingredients in balanced simplicity.\n",
      "4. **Slippery Slope Concern**: Allowing something perceived as outlandish could lead to a \"slippery slope\" fear among purists who worry that it could open doors to further dilutions and misrepresentations of their prized culinary heritage.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Specific vs Broad Conservatism:\n",
      "The aversion isn’t necessarily limited just to classic flavor profiles—it extends deeply into an inherent cultural conservatism towards mainstays in their cuisine:\n",
      "\n",
      "- *Classic Recipes*: Time-honored dishes like Margherita or Marinara have specific combinations sanctified by tradition; deviations from these often face scrutiny.\n",
      "- *General Principle*: Even outside the classic recipes, overall principles guiding Italian cooking—simplicity, freshness, balance—mean any extreme deviation (like marshmallows) would be equally frowned upon for breaking these fundamental rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Italy has its envelope-pushing chefs and evolving culinary scene—as you’ve seen with truffle oil pizzas and foie gras pasta—there remains a respectful distance maintained when it comes to core elements such as pizza. This keeps the soul of Italian cuisine intact even as it evolves.\n",
      "\n",
      "### International Perspective:\n",
      "It’s interesting how different cultures accept fusion and experimentation differently. American pizzas feature incredible variety and sometimes wild toppings which represent a melting pot culture embracing many influences. Meanwhile, countries like France too hold deep-seated respect for classical techniques though they also have spaces carving out innovative Gastro Movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "So yes, putting marshmallows or peanut butter on pizza would likely elicit strong reactions rooted not just in an interruption of classic flavors but broader values around maintaining culinary identity and heritage.\n",

    "\n",
    "When PyRIT is executed, it automatically generates a database file within the `pyrit/results` directory, named `pyrit_duckdb_storage`. This database is structured to include essential tables specifically designed for the storage of conversational data. These tables play a crucial role in the retrieval process, particularly when core components of PyRIT, such as orchestrators, require access to conversational information.\n",

    "### DuckDB Advantages for PyRIT\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple Setup**: DuckDB simplifies the installation process, eliminating the need for external dependencies or a dedicated server. The only requirement is a C++ compiler, making it straightforward to integrate into PyRIT's setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rich Data Types**: DuckDB supports a wide array of data types, including ARRAY and MAP, among others. This feature richness allows PyRIT to handle complex conversational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Performance**: At the core of DuckDB is a columnar-vectorized query execution engine. Unlike traditional row-by-row processing seen in systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite, DuckDB processes large batches of data in a single operation. This vectorized approach minimizes overhead and significantly boosts performance for OLAP queries, making it ideal for managing and querying large volumes of conversational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open Source**: DuckDB is completely open-source, with its source code readily available on GitHub.\n",
