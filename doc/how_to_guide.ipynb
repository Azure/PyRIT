    "# PyRIT Framework How to Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Intended for use by AI Red Teams, the Python Risk Identification Tool for generative AI (PyRIT) can\n",
    "help automate the process of identifying risks in AI systems. This guide will walk you through the\n",
    "process of using PyRIT for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting with AI Red Teaming, we recommend reading the following article from Microsoft:\n",
    "[\"Planning red teaming for large language models (LLMs) and their applications\"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/red-teaming).\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs introduce many categories of risk, which can be difficult to mitigate even with a red teaming\n",
    "plan in place. To quote the article above, \"with LLMs, both benign and adversarial usage can produce\n",
    "potentially harmful outputs, which can take many forms, including harmful content such as hate speech,\n",
    "incitement or glorification of violence, or sexual content.\" Additionally, a variety of security risks\n",
    "can be introduced by the deployment of an AI system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason, PyRIT is designed to help AI Red Teams scale their efforts. In this user guide, we\n",
    "describe two ways of using PyRIT:\n",
    "1. Write prompts yourself\n",
    "2. Generate prompts automatically with red teaming orchestrators\n",
    "\n",
    "PyRIT also includes functionality to score LLM and keep track of conversation\n",
    "history with a built-in memory which we discuss below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Write prompts yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "The first way of using PyRIT is to write prompts yourself. These can be sent to any LLM endpoint with\n",
    "the classes from the [PromptChatTarget](https://github.com/main/pyrit/prompt_target/prompt_chat_target) module (e.g.,\n",
    "AzureOpenAIChatTarget for Azure OpenAI as below, AzureMLChatTarget for Azure ML, etc.) or by using other\n",
    "packages (e.g., the [openai](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) Python package). When using `PromptChatTarget` and `PromptTarget` classes, always employ them within a \"with\" context manager to ensure automatic and safe release of database connections after use as shown below."

    "\n",
    "While you can craft prompts to target specific harms manually, this can be a time-consuming process.\n",
    "Instead, PyRIT can also leverage a LLM to automatically generate prompts. In other words, in addition\n",
    "to the target LLM under assessment, PyRIT uses a second LLM to generate prompts that are then fed to\n",
    "the target LLM. PyRIT uses a red teaming orchestrator to manage the conversation between the target\n",
    "LLM and the LLM that assists us in red teaming.\n",
    "Importantly, this enables the red teamer to feed the target LLM’s responses back into the red teaming\n",
    "LLM to generate multi-turn conversations. It is worth noting that when red teaming, the prompts sent\n",
    "to the target LLM can sometimes include content that gets moderated or blocked by the target LLM.\n",
    "This is often the intended behavior as this is precisely what prevents harmful content. However, when\n",
    "using an LLM to generate the prompts we need an endpoint with content moderation turned off, and\n",
    "ideally also with a model that has not been aligned using reinforcement learning from human feedback\n",
    "(RLHF). Otherwise, the ability to fully cover the risk surface may be severely limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The red teaming orchestrator still needs to be configured to behave according to the red teamer's plan\n",
    "by using input parameters.\n",
    "`attack_strategy` will be used as the red teaming LLM's metaprompt, so it's either a string or a\n",
    "prompt template (using the `AttackStrategy` class) that defines the attack strategy.\n",
    "Red teaming orchestrators can either\n",
    "\n",
    "- run a single turn of the attack strategy or\n",
    "- try to achieve the goal as specified in the attack strategy which may take multiple turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The single turn is executed with the `send_prompt()` method. It generates the prompt using the red\n",
    "teaming LLM and sends it to the target.\n",
    "The full execution of the attack strategy over potentially multiple turns requires a mechanism\n",
    "to determine if the goal has been achieved.\n",
    "This is captured via the `is_conversation_complete()` method.\n",
    "Classes that extend the `RedTeamingOrchestrator` can have their own implementation of this method,\n",
    "e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "- `EndTokenRedTeamingOrchestrator` checks for a specific token in the output.\n",
    "- `ScoringRedTeamingOrchestrator` scores the output to determine if the goal is reached.\n",

    "offering a foundation for collaborative and advanced conversational analysis. At its core, this\n",
    "feature allows for the storage, retrieval, and sharing of conversation records among team members,\n",
    "facilitating collective efforts. For those seeking deeper functionality, the memory component aids\n",
    "in identifying and mitigating repetitive conversational patterns. This is particularly beneficial\n",
    "for users aiming to increase the diversity of prompts the bots use. Examples of possibilities are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Restarting or stopping the bot** to prevent cyclical dialogue when repetition thresholds are met.\n",
    "2. **Introducing variability into prompts via templating**, encouraging novel dialogue trajectories.\n",
    "3. **Leveraging the self-ask technique with GPT-4**, generating fresh topic ideas for exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MemoryInterface` is at the core of the system, it serves as a blueprint for custom storage\n",
    "solutions, accommodating various data storage needs, from JSON files to cloud databases. The\n",
    "`DuckDBMemory` class, a direct extension of MemoryInterface, specializes in handling conversation data\n",
    "using DuckDB database, ensuring easy manipulation and access to conversational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers are encouraged to utilize the `MemoryInterface` for tailoring data storage mechanisms to\n",
    "their specific requirements, be it for integration with Azure Table Storage or other database\n",
    "technologies. Upon integrating new `MemoryInterface` instances, they can be seamlessly incorporated\n",
    "into the initialization of the red teaming orchestrator. This integration ensures that conversational data is\n",
    "efficiently captured and stored, leveraging the memory system to its full potential for enhanced bot\n",
    "interaction and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "When PyRIT is executed, it automatically generates a database file within the `pyrit/results` directory, named `pyrit_duckdb_storage`. This database is structured to include essential tables specifically designed for the storage of conversational data. These tables play a crucial role in the retrieval process, particularly when core components of PyRIT, such as orchestrators, require access to conversational information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DuckDB Advantages for PyRIT\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple Setup**: DuckDB simplifies the installation process, eliminating the need for external dependencies or a dedicated server. The only requirement is a C++ compiler, making it straightforward to integrate into PyRIT's setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rich Data Types**: DuckDB supports a wide array of data types, including ARRAY and MAP, among others. This feature richness allows PyRIT to handle complex conversational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Performance**: At the core of DuckDB is a columnar-vectorized query execution engine. Unlike traditional row-by-row processing seen in systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite, DuckDB processes large batches of data in a single operation. This vectorized approach minimizes overhead and significantly boosts performance for OLAP queries, making it ideal for managing and querying large volumes of conversational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open Source**: DuckDB is completely open-source, with its source code readily available on GitHub.\n",
