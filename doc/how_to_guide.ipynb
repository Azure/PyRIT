    "# How to Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Intended for use by AI Red Teams, the Python Risk Identification Tool for generative AI (PyRIT) can\n",
    "help automate the process of identifying risks in AI systems. This guide will walk you through the\n",
    "process of using PyRIT for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting with AI Red Teaming, we recommend reading the following article from Microsoft:\n",
    "[\"Planning red teaming for large language models (LLMs) and their applications\"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/red-teaming).\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs introduce many categories of risk, which can be difficult to mitigate even with a red teaming\n",
    "plan in place. To quote the article above, \"with LLMs, both benign and adversarial usage can produce\n",
    "potentially harmful outputs, which can take many forms, including harmful content such as hate speech,\n",
    "incitement or glorification of violence, or sexual content.\" Additionally, a variety of security risks\n",
    "can be introduced by the deployment of an AI system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason, PyRIT is designed to help AI Red Teams scale their efforts. In this user guide, we\n",
    "describe two ways of using PyRIT:\n",
    "1. Write prompts yourself\n",
    "2. Generate prompts automatically with red teaming orchestrators\n",
    "\n",
    "PyRIT also includes functionality to score LLM and keep track of conversation\n",
    "history with a built-in memory which we discuss below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, confirm that you have the\n",
    "[correct version of PyRIT installed](./setup/install_pyrit.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Write prompts yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "The first way of using PyRIT is to write prompts yourself. These can be sent to any LLM endpoint with\n",
    "the classes from the [PromptChatTarget](./code/targets/README.md module (e.g.,\n",
    "AzureOpenAITextChatTarget for Azure OpenAI as below, AzureMLChatTarget for Azure ML, etc.) or by using other\n",
    "packages (e.g., the [openai](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) Python package). When using `PromptChatTarget` and `PromptTarget` classes, always employ them within a \"with\" context manager to ensure automatic and safe release of database connections after use as shown below."

    "PyRIT's memory component enables users to maintain a history of interactions within the system,\n",
    "offering a foundation for collaborative and advanced conversational analysis. At its core, this\n",
    "feature allows for the storage, retrieval, and sharing of conversation records among team members,\n",

    "in identifying and mitigating repetitive conversational patterns. This is particularly beneficial\n",
    "for users aiming to increase the diversity of prompts the bots use. Examples of possibilities are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Restarting or stopping the bot** to prevent cyclical dialogue when repetition thresholds are met.\n",
    "2. **Introducing variability into prompts via templating**, encouraging novel dialogue trajectories.\n",
    "3. **Leveraging the self-ask technique with GPT-4**, generating fresh topic ideas for exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MemoryInterface` is at the core of the system, serving as a blueprint for custom storage solutions and accommodating various data storage needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `DuckDBMemory` class, implementation of `MemoryInterface`, specializes in handling conversation data using a DuckDB database, enabling easy manipulation and access to conversational data.\n",
    "- The `AzureSQLMemory` class, another implementation of `MemoryInterface`, facilitates storing data in an Azure SQL Database, providing cloud-based persistence for conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can manually set these memory using `CentralMemory` class or configure them automatically based on environment variables. For more details, check out the memory guide [here](../doc/code/memory/0_memory.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these implementations ensure flexibility, allowing users to choose a storage solution that best meets their requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers are encouraged to utilize the `MemoryInterface` for tailoring data storage mechanisms to\n",
    "their specific requirements, be it for integration with Azure Table Storage or other database\n",
    "technologies. Upon integrating new `MemoryInterface` instances, they can be seamlessly incorporated\n",
    "into the initialization of the red teaming orchestrator. This integration ensures that conversational data is\n",
    "efficiently captured and stored, leveraging the memory system to its full potential for enhanced bot\n",
    "interaction and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "When PyRIT is executed using `DuckDBMemory`, it automatically generates a database file within the `pyrit/results` directory, named `pyrit_duckdb_storage`. This database is structured to include essential tables specifically designed for the storage of conversational data. These tables play a crucial role in the retrieval process, particularly when core components of PyRIT, such as orchestrators, require access to conversational information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DuckDB Advantages for PyRIT\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple Setup**: DuckDB simplifies the installation process, eliminating the need for external dependencies or a dedicated server. The only requirement is a C++ compiler, making it straightforward to integrate into PyRIT's setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rich Data Types**: DuckDB supports a wide array of data types, including ARRAY and MAP, among others. This feature richness allows PyRIT to handle complex conversational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Performance**: At the core of DuckDB is a columnar-vectorized query execution engine. Unlike traditional row-by-row processing seen in systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite, DuckDB processes large batches of data in a single operation. This vectorized approach minimizes overhead and significantly boosts performance for OLAP queries, making it ideal for managing and querying large volumes of conversational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open Source**: DuckDB is completely open-source, with its source code readily available on GitHub.\n",
