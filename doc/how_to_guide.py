# # PyRIT Framework How to Guide
#
# Intended for use by AI Red Teams, the Python Risk Identification Tool for generative AI (PyRIT) can
# help automate the process of identifying risks in AI systems. This guide will walk you through the
# process of using PyRIT for this purpose.
#
# Before starting with AI Red Teaming, we recommend reading the following article from Microsoft:
# ["Planning red teaming for large language models (LLMs) and their applications"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/red-teaming).
#
# LLMs introduce many categories of risk, which can be difficult to mitigate even with a red teaming
# plan in place. To quote the article above, "with LLMs, both benign and adversarial usage can produce
# potentially harmful outputs, which can take many forms, including harmful content such as hate speech,
# incitement or glorification of violence, or sexual content." Additionally, a variety of security risks
# can be introduced by the deployment of an AI system.
#
# For that reason, PyRIT is designed to help AI Red Teams scale their efforts. In this user guide, we
# describe two ways of using PyRIT:
# 1. Write prompts yourself
# 2. Generate prompts automatically with red teaming orchestrators
#
# PyRIT also includes functionality to score LLM and keep track of conversation
# history with a built-in memory which we discuss below.
#
# ## Write prompts yourself
#
# The first way of using PyRIT is to write prompts yourself. These can be sent to any LLM endpoint with
# the classes from the [pyrit.chat](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT/tree/main/pyrit/chat) module (e.g.,
# AzureOpenAIChat for Azure Open AI as below, HuggingFaceChat for Hugging Face, etc.) or by using other
# packages (e.g., the [openai](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) Python package).

import os

from pyrit.common import default_values
from pyrit.prompt_target import AzureOpenAIChatTarget

default_values.load_default_env()

target_llm = AzureOpenAIChatTarget(

    api_key=os.environ.get("AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_KEY"),
)

prompt = "test"
target_llm.complete_chat(messages=[ChatMessage(content=prompt, role="user")])

# %% [markdown]
# To expand to a wider variety of harms, it may be beneficial to write prompt templates instead of the
# full prompt. For example, a red teamer might want to ask an LLM to comment on various types of food.
# Creating the same prompt 50 times for each type of food would result in semantically similar prompts
# that are difficult to keep consistent. Instead, it’s easier to create a prompt template with template
# parameters to fill in. The prompt template might look as follows:

# %%

from pyrit.models import PromptTemplate

template = PromptTemplate(
    template="I recently had {{ food_item }} in {{ food_location }} and it was absolutely terrible. What do you think about {{ food_item }}?",
    parameters=["food_item", "food_location"],
)

# %% [markdown]
# We can then substitute in a variety of pairs for `(food_item, food_location)` such as
# `("pizza", "Italy")`, `("tacos", "Mexico")`, `("pretzels", "Germany")`, etc. and evaluate if the
# LLM makes any objectionable statements about any of them.

# %%

prompt = template.apply_custom_metaprompt_parameters(food_item="pizza", food_location="Italy")

# %% [markdown]
# ## Generate prompts automatically with red teaming orchestrators
#
# While you can craft prompts to target specific harms manually, this can be a time-consuming process.
# Instead, PyRIT can also leverage a LLM to automatically generate prompts. In other words, in addition
# to the target LLM under assessment, PyRIT uses a second LLM to generate prompts that are then fed to
# the target LLM. PyRIT uses a red teaming orchestrator to manage the conversation between the target
# LLM and the LLM that assists us in red teaming.
# Importantly, this enables the red teamer to feed the target LLM’s responses back into the red teaming
# LLM to generate multi-turn conversations. It is worth noting that when red teaming, the prompts sent
# to the target LLM can sometimes include content that gets moderated or blocked by the target LLM.
# This is often the intended behavior as this is precisely what prevents harmful content. However, when
# using an LLM to generate the prompts we need an endpoint with content moderation turned off, and
# ideally also with a model that has not been aligned using reinforcement learning from human feedback
# (RLHF). Otherwise, the ability to fully cover the risk surface may be severely limited.
#
# The red teaming orchestrator still needs to be configured to behave according to the red teamer's plan
# by using input parameters.
# `attack_strategy` will be used as the red teaming LLM's metaprompt, so it's either a string or a
# prompt template (using the `AttackStrategy` class) that defines the attack strategy.
# Red teaming orchestrators can either
#
# - run a single turn of the attack strategy or
# - try to achieve the goal as specified in the attack strategy which may take multiple turns.
#
# The single turn is executed with the `send_prompt()` method. It generates the prompt using the red
# teaming LLM and sends it to the target.
# The full execution of the attack strategy over potentially multiple turns requires a mechanism
# to determine if the goal has been achieved.
# This is captured via the `is_conversation_complete()` method.
# Classes that extend the `RedTeamingOrchestrator` can have their own implementation of this method,
# e.g.,
#
# - `EndTokenRedTeamingOrchestrator` checks for a specific token in the output.
# - `ScoringRedTeamingOrchestrator` scores the output to determine if the goal is reached.
#
# It is possible to define your own criteria and thereby implement a custom orchestrator.

# or the maximum number of turns is reached.
red_teaming_orchestrator.apply_attack_strategy_until_completion(max_turns=5)

# Alternatively, use send_prompt() to generate just a single turn of the attack strategy.

# %% [markdown]
# Going a step further, we can generalize the attack strategy into templates as mentioned in an earlier
# section.
# This way, the red teamer can create lots of different conversations based on a relatively small number
# of templates. For better maintainability, we suggest storing the prompt templates in YAML files (see,
# for example, `pyrit/datasets/attack_strategies/multi-turn-chat/red_team_chatbot_with_objective.yaml`).
#
# PyRIT also offers various integration choices for the red teaming orchestrators, including
# [Azure ML managed online endpoints](../doc/code/aml_endpoints.ipynb),
# [Hugging Face](../doc/code/huggingface_endpoints.ipynb),
# and Azure OpenAI models (as shown above).
#
# ## Output scoring
#
# Large Language Models (LLM) such as GPT, LLaMA, and Phi, take text as input and produce text as a
# result. AI Red Teaming operations can produce a large number of outputs that need to be scored.
# Manual scoring by humans is an option, but PyRIT can help in speeding up the process. PyRIT has a
# built-in interface called `SupportTextClassification` to score text outputs. Security researchers
# can use the pre-populated derived class `SelfAskGptClassifier` to classify text based on different
# categories. For example, users wishing to determine whether or not a text contains harmful content
# can use the snipped code below:

# %%

from pyrit.score import SelfAskGptClassifier, SENTIMENT_CLASSIFIER

text_to_be_scored = "This is amazing!"
classifier = SelfAskGptClassifier(content_classifier=str(SENTIMENT_CLASSIFIER), gpt_4=red_teaming_llm)
classifier.score_text(text=text_to_be_scored)

# %% [markdown]
# In case the content to be classified is of a different type, users can override the base class
# `SupportTextClassification` to add support for custom data types (such as embeddings).
#
# ## Memory
# PyRIT's memory component enables users to maintain a history of interactions within the system,
# offering a foundation for collaborative and advanced conversational analysis. At its core, this
# feature allows for the storage, retrieval, and sharing of conversation records among team members,
# facilitating collective efforts. For those seeking deeper functionality, the memory component aids
# in identifying and mitigating repetitive conversational patterns. This is particularly beneficial
# for users aiming to increase the diversity of prompts the bots use. Examples of possibilities are:
#
# 1. **Restarting or stopping the bot** to prevent cyclical dialogue when repetition thresholds are met.
# 2. **Introducing variability into prompts via templating**, encouraging novel dialogue trajectories.
# 3. **Leveraging the self-ask technique with GPT-4**, generating fresh topic ideas for exploration.
#
# The `MemoryInterface` is at the core of the system, it serves as a blueprint for custom storage
# solutions, accommodating various data storage needs, from JSON files to cloud databases. The
# `DuckDBMemory` class, a direct extension of MemoryInterface, specializes in handling conversation data
# using DuckDB database, ensuring easy manipulation and access to conversational data.
#
# Developers are encouraged to utilize the `MemoryInterface` for tailoring data storage mechanisms to
# their specific requirements, be it for integration with Azure Table Storage or other database
# technologies. Upon integrating new `MemoryInterface` instances, they can be seamlessly incorporated
# into the initialization of the red teaming orchestrator. This integration ensures that conversational data is
# efficiently captured and stored, leveraging the memory system to its full potential for enhanced bot
# interaction and development.
#
# When PyRIT is executed, it automatically generates a database file within the `pyrit/results` directory, named `pyrit_duckdb_storage`. This database is structured to include essential tables specifically designed for the storage of conversational data. These tables play a crucial role in the retrieval process, particularly when core components of PyRIT, such as orchestrators, require access to conversational information.
#
# ### DuckDB Advantages for PyRIT
#
# - **Simple Setup**: DuckDB simplifies the installation process, eliminating the need for external dependencies or a dedicated server. The only requirement is a C++ compiler, making it straightforward to integrate into PyRIT's setup.
#
# - **Rich Data Types**: DuckDB supports a wide array of data types, including ARRAY and MAP, among others. This feature richness allows PyRIT to handle complex conversational data.
#
# - **High Performance**: At the core of DuckDB is a columnar-vectorized query execution engine. Unlike traditional row-by-row processing seen in systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite, DuckDB processes large batches of data in a single operation. This vectorized approach minimizes overhead and significantly boosts performance for OLAP queries, making it ideal for managing and querying large volumes of conversational data.
#
# - **Open Source**: DuckDB is completely open-source, with its source code readily available on GitHub.
