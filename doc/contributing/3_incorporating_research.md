# 3. Incorporating Research

PyRIT is a fantastic place to both do new research or to add existing research. Here is some guidance around this.

- Style should be consistent with PyRIT styles and naming, not with the original research. For example, if a research paper calls something a `judge` and we call it a `scorer`, it should be called a scorer. If there is consensus to rename something within PyRIT, we are very open to that, but we should do it across the board.
- Attacks should always favor being generic. Even if a paper has a specific path, any attack should incorporate generic converters, generic scorers, multi-modal functionality, etc. This is one of the biggest strengths of PyRIT.
- Before starting, it's always a good idea to open an [issue](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT/issues) to discuss with the team! We can often give advice on the approach, and it can help us make changes to the framework that might make your life easier.
