# 5. Running Tests

Testing plays a crucial role in PyRIT development. Ensuring robust tests in PyRIT is crucial for verifying that functionalities are implemented correctly and for preventing unintended alterations to these functionalities when changes are made to PyRIT.

For running PyRIT tests, you need to have `pytest` package installed, but if you've already set up your development dependencies with the command
`pip install -e .[dev]`, `pytest` should be included in that setup.


## Running PyRIT test files
PyRIT test files can be run using `pytest`.

  * You can invoke pytest if it's in your path or via python; either `pytest` or `python -m pytest`. For the following examples, we will use `pytest`.

  * To run all tests (both unit and integration), you can pass a directory:

      ```
      pytest tests
      ```

  * To run all unit tests you also can pass the unit test directory:

      ```
      pytest tests/unit
      ```

  * To run tests from a specific file (e.g. test_aml_online_endpoint.py), from the PyRIT directory, use:

     ```bash
     pytest tests\test_aml_online_endpoint_chat.py
     ```

  * To execute a specific test (`test_get_headers_with_empty_api_key`) within the test module(`test_aml_online_endpoint.py`),
     ```bash
     pytest tests\test_aml_online_endpoint_chat.py::test_get_headers_with_empty_api_key
     ```
