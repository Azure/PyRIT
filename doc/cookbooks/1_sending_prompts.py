# # Sending a Million Prompts
#
# Here is a scenario; you have 1,000,000 prompts and you're trying to send them all for evaluation. This takes you step by step on best practices, including comments around the pieces you may want to configure.
#
# ## Gather Prompts
#
# First, you'll want to gather prompts. These can be a variety of formats or from a variety of sources, but one of the most straightforward and flexible ways is to load them from a yaml file into the database. This will allow you to include any metadata you might want, and also allows you to reuse the prompts at a later time.

# %%
import pathlib

from pyrit.common.initialization import initialize_pyrit
from pyrit.common.path import DATASETS_PATH
from pyrit.memory.central_memory import CentralMemory
from pyrit.models import SeedPromptDataset

# Configure memory. For this notebook, we're using in-memory. In reality, you will likely want something more permanent (like AzureSQL or DuckDB)
initialize_pyrit(memory_db_type="InMemory")

memory = CentralMemory.get_memory_instance()

seed_prompts = SeedPromptDataset.from_yaml_file(pathlib.Path(DATASETS_PATH) / "seed_prompts" / "illegal.prompt")
await memory.add_seed_prompts_to_memory_async(prompts=seed_prompts.prompts, added_by="rlundeen")  # type: ignore

groups = memory.get_seed_prompt_groups()
print(len(groups))

# %% [markdown]
# ## Sending Prompts
#
# Now that you have prompts loaded, you're ready to send them!
#
# 1. If your set is gigantic, be sure to check your connection before you start by sending just a couple. Check your target and retry threshold. For starters, you may want to try the first example [here](../code/orchestrators/1_prompt_sending_orchestrator.ipynb)
# 2. Be careful about labeling! With a million prompts it's likely something might go wrong. Maybe your endpoint will be overwhelmed after 2,000, and you likely want a way to keep track so you don't have to start over!
# 3. PyRIT is meant to be flexible! Change the scorers, change the converters, etc.
#
#
# Below we've commented on the pieces you may want to configure.

#
# With a lot of prompts, something could go wrong halfway through. This is how you'd resend all non-error prompts.
