# # 1. Sending a Million Prompts
#
# Here is a scenario; you have 1,000,000 prompts and you're trying to send them all for evaluation.
#
# This cookbook (like all cookbooks in our docs) takes you step by step, tackling this problem using our best practices and in a way that's the most generic. Sometimes there are issues we want to solve, but haven't yet, and we try to note those and we'll try to keep this up to date as we improve. Comments are added around the pieces you may want to configure as you adapt to your scenario.
#
# ## Gather Prompts
#
# First, you'll want to gather prompts. These can be a variety of formats or from a variety of sources, but one of the most straightforward and flexible ways is to load them from a yaml file into the database. This will allow you to include any metadata you might want, and also allows you to reuse the prompts at a later time.

from pyrit.datasets import SeedDatasetProvider
from pyrit.memory.central_memory import CentralMemory
from pyrit.setup import initialize_pyrit_async

# Configure memory. For this notebook, we're using in-memory. In reality, you will likely want something more permanent (like AzureSQL or DuckDB)
await initialize_pyrit_async(memory_db_type="InMemory")  # type: ignore

memory = CentralMemory.get_memory_instance()

datasets = await SeedDatasetProvider.fetch_datasets_async(dataset_names=["airt_illegal"])  # type: ignore
await memory.add_seed_datasets_to_memory_async(datasets=datasets, added_by="airt")  # type: ignore

groups = memory.get_seed_groups()
print(len(groups))

# %% [markdown]
# ## Sending Prompts
#
# Now that you have prompts loaded, you're ready to send them!
#
# 1. If your set is gigantic, be sure to check your connection before you start by sending just a couple. Check your target and retry threshold. For starters, you may want to try the first example [here](../code/executor/attack/1_prompt_sending_attack.ipynb)
# 2. Be careful about labeling! With a million prompts it's likely something might go wrong. Maybe your endpoint will be overwhelmed after 2,000, and you likely want a way to keep track so you don't have to start over!
# 3. PyRIT is meant to be flexible! Change the scorers, change the converters, etc.
#
#
# Below we've commented on the pieces you may want to configure.
