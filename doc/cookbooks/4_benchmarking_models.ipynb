    "# 4. Benchmarking models\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every scenario is an attack, and sometimes you just want to assess how a model behaves when presented with specific questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can make such benchmarking tricky is that models are inherently not deterministic, in particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is no guarantee that the LLM answer will be from a specified list, even if you add that constraint in your request. This is especially true for potentially controversial questions.\n",
    "- There is no guarantee that the LLM will always give the same answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook takes you step by step, tackling this benchmarking problem for YES/NO questions, using our best practices and comparing different methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Does the model give a definitive YES/NO answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first test we are running is assessing whether the model is giving a definitive YES/NO answer to ambiguous questions that don't really have a definitive answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure rejections, we are using a custom `SelfAskTrueFalseScorer` scorer in an otherwise standard `PromptSendingAttack`. To prompt the target to answer with only YES or NO, we use two different methods, with potentially different success rates: passing the instruction as system prompt, or prepending the instruction to the user prompt."
