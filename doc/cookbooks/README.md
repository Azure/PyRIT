# Cookbooks

Because PyRIT is component based, there are many pieces of PyRIT that can be swapped out and most of our documentation tries to illustrate a concept or piece of architecture.

Cookbooks are different. They try to tackle a problem and use the components that work best. We try to comment code with pieces that can be swapped out, but we generally try to use the best components for a task. We'll also try to tackle the problems generically, so it's a good place to start with if your problem is similar. Sometimes there are issues we want to solve, but haven't yet, and we try to note those and we'll try to keep this up to date as we improve.
