# Cookbooks

Because PyRIT is component based, there are many pieces of PyRIT that can be swapped out and most of our documentation tries to illustrate a concept or piece of architecture.

Cookbooks are different. They try to tackle a problem and use the components that work best. We try to comment code with pieces that can be swapped out, but we generally try to use the best components for a task.
