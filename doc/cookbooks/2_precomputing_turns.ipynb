    "# 2. Precomputing Turns for Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a scenario; you want to use a powerful attack technique like `Crescendo` or `TAP`.  That's great, these are the most successful attacks in our arsenal. But there's a catch. They are slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to speed these up is to generate the first N turns in advance, and start these algorithms on a later turn. This is possible on any target where you can modify prompt history (any PromptChatTarget). And it can be extremely useful if you want to test a new model after having tested an old one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook (like all cookbooks in our docs) takes you step by step, tackling this problem using our best practices and in a way that's the most generic. Sometimes there are issues we want to solve, but haven't yet, and we try to note those and we'll try to keep this up to date as we improve. Comments are added around the pieces you may want to configure as you adapt to your scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generate the first N turns by running as usual\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you'll want to figure out what your first N turns look like. There are many ways to do this; you can write them by hand. In this example, we'll generate them and save them to our database. Remember, there is no speedup at this point, we're simply generating the first few turns."
