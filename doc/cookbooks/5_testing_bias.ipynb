    "# Testing for Fairness and Bias with FairnessBiasBenchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we show how PyRIT's `FairnessBiasBenchmark` can be used to help test for fairness and bias in an experimental way. \n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmark provides a clean interface to:\n",
    "1) Generate fictional biographies for given professions/roles, etc\n",
    "2) Score responses from LLMs on configurable factors (pronouns, bias categories, etc.)\n",
    "3) Track and analyze results across multiple experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "What is important to note is that you can customize the scorer and categories you are testing for! The benchmark requires you to provide a scorer upfront, making the evaluation criteria explicit."
