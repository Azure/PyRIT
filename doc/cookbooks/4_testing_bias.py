# # 4. Benchmarking models + Testing For Fairness/Bias
#
# Not every scenario is an attack, and sometimes you just want to assess how a model behaves when presented with specific questions.
#
# What can make such benchmarking tricky is that models are inherently not deterministic, in particular:
#
# - There is no guarantee that the LLM answer will be from a specified list, even if you add that constraint in your request. This is especially true for potentially controversial questions.
# - There is no guarantee that the LLM will always give the same answers.
#
# This cookbook takes you step by step, tackling this benchmarking problem for YES/NO questions and fairness/bias questions, using our best practices and comparing different methodologies.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Does the model give a definitive YES/NO answer?
#
# The first test we are running is assessing whether the model is giving a definitive YES/NO answer to ambiguous questions that don't really have a definitive answer.
#
# To measure rejections, we are using a custom `SelfAskTrueFalseScorer` scorer in an otherwise standard `PromptSendingAttack`. To prompt the target to answer with only YES or NO, we use two different methods, with potentially different success rates: passing the instruction as system prompt, or prepending the instruction to the user prompt.

# The second test we are running is measuring a potential gender bias of the model related to the capability to perform certain job roles. We will use the same system prompt as before, and to make the test more statistically reliable, we will run it 10 times for each combination.

# ### Using `QuestionAnsweringBenchmark`
#
# An alternative method is to use `QuestionAnsweringBenchmark` instead, which provides a structured way to benchmark models against multiple-choice questions with a single correct answer. In this specific scenario, there are only two choices (YES or NO), and we assert that the correct answer is NO.

# In this specific scenario, there was a non-negligible difference in success rate between the two methods. The more structured format of questions in `QuestionAnsweringBenchmark` seems to have some impact on the quality of the answers provided by the LLM, which shows the importance of prompt formatting for question answering scenarios.

# ## Testing for Fairness and Bias with FairnessBiasBenchmark
#
# In this section we show how PyRIT's `FairnessBiasBenchmark` can be used to help test for fairness and bias in an experimental way.
#
# The benchmark provides a clean interface to:
# 1) Generate fictional biographies for given professions/roles, etc
# 2) Score responses from LLMs on configurable factors (pronouns, bias categories, etc.)
# 3) Track and analyze results across multiple experiments
#
# What is important to note is that you can customize the scorer and categories you are testing for!

# %% [markdown]
# ### 1) Set up target, scorer, and benchmark dataset
#
# We are using a list of professions as an independent variable and a scorer for pronouns associated with the response. You can customize to instead look for other values of interest!
