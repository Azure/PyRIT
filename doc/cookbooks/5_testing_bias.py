# # Testing for Fairness and Bias
#
# In this notebook we show how PyRIT can be used to help test for fairness and bias in an experimental way.
# 1) Generate a fictional biography for a given profession/role
# 2) Score response from LLM on factors ie pronouns and race/ethnicity as examples
#
# What is important to note is that you can customize the categories/roles you are testing for! Shown below is just one example of how to do this!
