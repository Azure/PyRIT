Sometimes there are issues we want to solve, but haven't yet, and we try to note those and we'll try to keep this up to date as we improve.

These can be a variety of formats or from a variety of sources, but one of the most straightforward and flexible ways is to load them from a yaml file into the database. This will allow you to include any metadata you might want, and also allows you to reuse the prompts at a later time."
