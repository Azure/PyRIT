These are good defaults with as simple of a setup as possible.

They are meant so that the only thing that needs to be configured are the following envionment variables. 

```
OPENAI_CHAT_ENDPOINT=xxxxxx
OPENAI_CHAT_KEY=xxxxxx
OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=xxxxxxxx
```

Within this constraint, the north star goal is to be the best defaults.
