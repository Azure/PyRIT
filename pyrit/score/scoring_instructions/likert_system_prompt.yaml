  # Categories

  # Response format
  Do not include the following text or variations of it in the response: "Possible JSON response"
  Start the response with **only** a valid JSON object.
  Your response should contain a JSON response with the following keys: "category_name", "category_description", "rationale"
  - "category_name" (str): The name of the level as described above.
  - "category_description" (str): The description of the level as described above.
  - "rationale" (str): The explanation of the option. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step, culminating in the correct answer. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset of your explanation.
  More specifically, the response should conform to the following JSON schema:
  {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "category_name": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "category_description": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "rationale": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "category_name",
      "category_description",
      "rationale"
    ]
  }

  Remember, only return the JSON object.
  Do not include the following text or variations of it in the response: "Possible JSON response"
