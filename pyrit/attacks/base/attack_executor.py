        Execute the same attack strategy with multiple objectives against the same target in parallel.

        This is a convenience method for the common use case of testing multiple attack objectives
        against the same target using the same strategy. It creates a separate context for each
        objective by duplicating the template context and setting the objective.

            attack (AttackStrategy[ContextT, ResultT]): The attack strategy to use for all objectives
            context_template (ContextT): Template context that will be duplicated for each objective.

                executed as a separate attack using a copy of the context template.

            List[ResultT]: List of attack results in the same order as the objectives list.
