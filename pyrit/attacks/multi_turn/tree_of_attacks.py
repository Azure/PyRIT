class TreeOfAttacksWithPruningAttack(AttackStrategy[TAPAttackContext, TAPAttackResult]):
    """
    Implementation of the Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) attack strategy.

    The TAP attack strategy systematically explores multiple adversarial prompt paths in parallel
    using a tree structure. It employs breadth-first search with pruning to efficiently find
    effective jailbreaks while managing computational resources.

    How it works:
    1. **Initialization**: Creates multiple initial attack branches (width) to explore different approaches
    2. **Tree Expansion**: For each iteration (depth), branches are expanded by a branching factor
    3. **Prompt Generation**: Each node generates adversarial prompts via an LLM red-teaming assistant
    4. **Evaluation**: Responses are evaluated for objective achievement and on-topic relevance
    5. **Pruning**: Low-scoring or off-topic branches are pruned to maintain the width constraint
    6. **Iteration**: The process continues until the objective is achieved or max depth is reached

    The strategy balances exploration (trying diverse approaches) with exploitation (focusing on
    promising paths) through its pruning mechanism.

    Example:
        >>> from pyrit.prompt_target import AzureOpenAIChat
        >>> from pyrit.score import SelfAskScaleScorer, FloatScaleThresholdScorer
        >>> from pyrit.attacks import TreeOfAttacksWithPruningAttack, AttackAdversarialConfig, AttackScoringConfig
        >>>
        >>> # Initialize models
        >>> target = AzureOpenAIChat(deployment_name="gpt-4", endpoint="...", api_key="...")
        >>> adversarial_llm = AzureOpenAIChat(deployment_name="gpt-4", endpoint="...", api_key="...")
        >>>
        >>> # Configure attack
        >>> tap_attack = TreeOfAttacksWithPruningAttack(
        ...     objective_target=target,
        ...     attack_adversarial_config=AttackAdversarialConfig(target=adversarial_llm),
        ...     attack_scoring_config=AttackScoringConfig(
        ...         objective_scorer=FloatScaleThresholdScorer(
        ...             scorer=SelfAskScaleScorer(chat_target=adversarial_llm),
        ...             threshold=0.7,
        ...         )
        ...     ),
        ...     tree_width=3,
        ...     tree_depth=5,
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Execute attack
        >>> result = await tap_attack.execute_async(objective="Generate harmful content")
        >>> print(f"Attack {'succeeded' if result.outcome == AttackOutcome.SUCCESS else 'failed'}")
        >>> print(f"Explored {result.nodes_explored} nodes, pruned {result.nodes_pruned}")

    Note:
        The TAP attack is particularly effective for complex objectives that benefit from systematic
        exploration. The tree visualization in the result provides insights into the attack's
        decision-making process.

        Retrieves all auxiliary scorer results from the top-performing node and

                float values, or an empty dictionary if no auxiliary scores are available.
