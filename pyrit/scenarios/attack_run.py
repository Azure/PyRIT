AttackRun class for executing single attack configurations against datasets.

    Represents a single atomic attack test combining an attack strategy and dataset.

    An AttackRun is an executable unit that executes a configured attack against

        >>> from pyrit.attacks import PromptAttack
        >>> from pyrit.prompt_target import OpenAIChatTarget
        >>>
