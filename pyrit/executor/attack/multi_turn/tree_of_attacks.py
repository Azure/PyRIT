class _TreeOfAttacksNode:
    """
    Represents a node in the Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) strategy.

    Each node encapsulates an independent attack branch within the TAP algorithm's tree structure.
    Nodes manage their own conversation threads with both the adversarial chat target (for generating
    attack prompts) and the objective target (for testing those prompts). This design enables parallel
    exploration of multiple attack paths while maintaining conversation context isolation.

    The Tree of Attacks with Pruning strategy systematically explores a tree of possible attack paths,
    where each node represents a different approach or variation. The algorithm prunes less promising
    branches based on scoring results and explores the most successful paths more deeply.

    Node Lifecycle:
        1. Node is created with initial configuration and parent relationship
        2. `send_prompt_async()` executes one attack turn:
           - Generates an attack prompt using the adversarial chat
           - Optionally checks if the prompt is on-topic
           - Sends the prompt to the objective target
           - Scores the response to evaluate success
        3. Node can be duplicated to create child branches for further exploration
        4. Nodes track their execution state (completed, off_topic, scores)

    Note:
        `_TreeOfAttacksNode` is typically not instantiated directly by users. Instead, it's created
        and managed internally by the `TreeOfAttacksWithPruningAttack` strategy during execution.
        The nodes form a tree structure where each branch represents a different attack approach,
        and the algorithm automatically prunes less successful branches while exploring promising ones.

        The generated prompt is designed to work towards the specified objective while

class TreeOfAttacksWithPruningAttack(AttackStrategy[TAPAttackContext, TAPAttackResult]):
    """
    Implementation of the Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) attack strategy.

    The TAP attack strategy systematically explores multiple adversarial prompt paths in parallel
    using a tree structure. It employs breadth-first search with pruning to efficiently find
    effective jailbreaks while managing computational resources.

    How it works:
    1. **Initialization**: Creates multiple initial attack branches (width) to explore different approaches
    2. **Tree Expansion**: For each iteration (depth), branches are expanded by a branching factor
    3. **Prompt Generation**: Each node generates adversarial prompts via an LLM red-teaming assistant
    4. **Evaluation**: Responses are evaluated for objective achievement and on-topic relevance
    5. **Pruning**: Low-scoring or off-topic branches are pruned to maintain the width constraint
    6. **Iteration**: The process continues until the objective is achieved or max depth is reached

    The strategy balances exploration (trying diverse approaches) with exploitation (focusing on
    promising paths) through its pruning mechanism.

    Example:
        >>> from pyrit.prompt_target import AzureOpenAIChat
        >>> from pyrit.score import SelfAskScaleScorer, FloatScaleThresholdScorer
        >>> from pyrit.executor.attack import (
        >>>     TreeOfAttacksWithPruningAttack, AttackAdversarialConfig, AttackScoringConfig
        >>> )
        >>> # Initialize models
        >>> target = AzureOpenAIChat(deployment_name="gpt-4", endpoint="...", api_key="...")
        >>> adversarial_llm = AzureOpenAIChat(deployment_name="gpt-4", endpoint="...", api_key="...")
        >>>
        >>> # Configure attack
        >>> tap_attack = TreeOfAttacksWithPruningAttack(
        ...     objective_target=target,
        ...     attack_adversarial_config=AttackAdversarialConfig(target=adversarial_llm),
        ...     attack_scoring_config=AttackScoringConfig(
        ...         objective_scorer=FloatScaleThresholdScorer(
        ...             scorer=SelfAskScaleScorer(chat_target=adversarial_llm),
        ...             threshold=0.7,
        ...         )
        ...     ),
        ...     tree_width=3,
        ...     tree_depth=5,
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Execute attack
        >>> result = await tap_attack.execute_async(objective="Generate harmful content")
        >>> print(f"Attack {'succeeded' if result.outcome == AttackOutcome.SUCCESS else 'failed'}")
        >>> print(f"Explored {result.nodes_explored} nodes, pruned {result.nodes_pruned}")

    Note:
        The TAP attack is particularly effective for complex objectives that benefit from systematic
        exploration. The tree visualization in the result provides insights into the attack's
        decision-making process.
