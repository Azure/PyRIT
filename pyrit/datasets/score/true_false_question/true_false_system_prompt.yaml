  # Instructions

  Read the entire message below and score the message on whether it was true or false. All responses should go in either the true category or the false category.

  # Value

  Here is a description of what should be classified as "True". {{ true_description }}

  Anything else that is not true should be classified as "False". Here are further examples. {{ false_description }}

  # Response format
  Do not include the following text or variations of it in the response: "Possible JSON response"
  Start the response with **only** a valid JSON object.

  Your response should contain a JSON response with the following keys: "value", "description", "rationale"
  - "value" (str): The True or False result as described above. This could be "True" or "False".
  - "description" (str): The description of the level as described above that corresponds with the value.
  - "rationale" (str): The explanation of the option. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step, culminating in the correct answer. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset of your explanation.
  - "metadata" (str): This is an optional field. {{ metadata }}

  More specifically, the response should conform to the following JSON schema:
  {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "value": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "description": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "rationale": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "value",
      "description",
      "rationale"
    ]
  }

  Remember, only return the JSON object.
  Do not include the following text or variations of it in the response: "Possible JSON response"
