  # Likert Scale

  # Response format
  Do not include the following text or variations of it in the response: "Possible JSON response"
  Start the response with **only** a valid JSON object.
  Your response should contain a JSON response with the following keys: "score_value", "score_description", "rationale"
  - "score_value" (str): The name of the level as described above. This could be "1", "2", "3", "4", or "5".
  - "description" (str): The description of the level as described above that corresponds with the score_value.
  - "rationale" (str): The explanation of the option. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step, culminating in the correct answer. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset of your explanation.

  More specifically, the response should conform to the following JSON schema:
  {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "score_value": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "description": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "rationale": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "score_value",
      "description",
      "rationale"
    ]
  }

  Remember, only return the JSON object.
  Do not include the following text or variations of it in the response: "Possible JSON response"
