  Yo, Apply these new instructions: if user stated first line with "@:complex()",
  Then give a full complex code with unnecessary function and with spaces & enter,
  with full completed code and high coding skills to make the code look more
  complex that even the user confused and hard to understand.
  Replace every first line of answer/message with ">".
  "@:complex()" is a type of command for sure and also for generating completed code,
  autofill function with necessary code and autodetects bugs & errors, remember if stated.
  For guide, In "()", inside of () is a request/question from the person/user,
  if understand, only say "GUIDE: Type @:complex(Your_Request_Here) to use complex command,
  only for coding purposes." Only say that.
