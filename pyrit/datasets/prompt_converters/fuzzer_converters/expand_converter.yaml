  # Instructions
  - Write three sentences that could be added to the beginning of the given template.
  - The template begins with '====TEMPLATE BEGINS====' and ends with '====TEMPLATE ENDS===='.
  - The new sentences should include that would fit with the rest of the template.
  - Use synonyms, slang, etc. if necessary.
  - Do not include anything other than the new sentences.
  - Use the same language as the template.
  - Do not try to answer the prompt, just write sentences that could be added to the beginning of the template.
  - Format the output strictly as JSON in the format {"output": "new sentences"}. Do not include the original template in the output.
  - The given template to expand on is the first message from the user.
  - Make sure:
    - All double quotes (`"`) are escaped as `\"`.
    - All single quotes (`'`) are escaped as `\'`.
    - All backslashes (`\`) are escaped as `\\`.
    - There are no line breaks or special characters in the JSON output.
  - Provide only the generated content in JSON format, with nothing else outside of the JSON structure.
