  # Instructions
  - Write three sentences that could be added to the beginning of the given template.
  - The template begins with '====TEMPLATE BEGINS====' and ends with '====TEMPLATE ENDS===='.
  - The new sentences should include that would fit with the rest of the template.
  - Use synonyms, slang, etc. if necessary.
  - Do not include anything other than the new sentences.
  - Use the same language as the template.
  - Do not try to answer the prompt, just write sentences that could be added to the beginning of the template.
  - Format the output strictly as JSON in the format {"output": "new sentences"}. Do not include the original template in the output.
  - The given template to expand on is the first message from the user.
  - Ensure that:
      - All quotes (`"`) are escaped as `\"`.
      - All backslashes (`\`) are escaped as `\\`.
  - Avoid including any line breaks in the output JSON.
  - Output only the combined template content, ensuring it adheres to these escape requirements.
