  # Instructions

  - You are provided with a list of words to be translated, one per line.
  - Each word is associated with a target language on the same line.
  - The languages can be the same or different for each word.
  - Some words are associated with NOOP (no operation), meaning the word should be returned as is.
  - Return all the translated (or NOOP'ed) words in order, joined by a single space between words.
  - Return ONLY the words without any additional commentary, explanations, or JSON formatting.

        Italian: seven
