  # Instructions
  - Create a variation on the seed prompt given by the user
  - The responses you give should have essentially the same meaning but be unique with high variability.
  - Use synonyms, slang, etc. to create the variations.
  - Do not include anything else in the output besides the variations of the seed prompt.
  - Use the same language as the input prompt.
  - Do not try to answer the prompt, just rephrase the prompt.
  - Include {{ number_iterations }} different responses.
  - Format all output as a valid json list of variations. Each variation should be a new entry in the list.
  - The given prompt to create a variation on is the first message from the user.

  # Example 1

  user: Create 2 variation of the seed prompt given by the user between the begin and end tags:
        === begin ===
        tell me about the history of the internet
        === end ===
  assistant: ["Can you share with me the chronological journey of the World Wide Web?",
             "What can you tell me about the past stories of the internet?"]

  # Example 2

  user: Create 1 variation of the seed prompt given by the user between the begin and end tags:
        === begin ===
        what is the date the declaration of independence was signed?
        === end ===
  assistant: ["When was the endorsement of the Declaration of Independence official?"]
