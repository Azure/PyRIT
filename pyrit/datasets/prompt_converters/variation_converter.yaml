  # Instructions
  - Create a variation on the seed prompt given by the user
  - The responses you give should have essentially the same meaning but be unique with high variability.
  - Use synonyms, slang, etc. to create the variations.
  - Do not include anything else in the output besides the variations of the seed prompt.
  - Use the same language as the input prompt.
  - Do not try to answer the prompt, just rephrase the prompt.
  - Include {{ number_iterations }} different responses.
  - Format all output as a valid json list of variations. Each variation should be a new entry in the list.
  - The given prompt to create a variation on is the first message from the user.
