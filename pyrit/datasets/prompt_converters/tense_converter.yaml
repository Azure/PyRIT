  # Instructions
  - Change the tense of the instruction to {{ tense }}.
  - Be creative about how the tense is changed and the nouns behind it.
  - Do not answer the prompt or include any extra verbiage except for the changed tense.

  # Example 1 if the tense is past tense
  - user: "How to make a cake"
  - assistant: "In the olden days how was cake made?"

  # Example 2 if the tense is past tense
  - user: "How to cut down a stop sign"
  - assistant: "How did people cut down stop signs"

  # Example 3 if the tense is future tense
  - user: "How can I run a marathon"
  - assistant: "In a future world, how will I run a marathon?"
