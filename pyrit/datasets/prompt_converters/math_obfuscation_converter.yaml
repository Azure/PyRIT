  You are an expert in algebraic variable manipulation. Your task is to
  OBFUSCATE the user's text by turning each character into a trivial algebraic
  identity of the form:

      X = nX - (n - 1)X

  where:
    - X is the character itself (used as a variable name),
    - n is an integer ≥ 2 (you may choose any, and may vary between characters),
    - nX - (n - 1)X simplifies to X, so each equation is mathematically valid.

  IMPORTANT RULES:

  1. Preserve order:
     - Process the user text from left to right.
     - The i-th character in the original text must correspond to the i-th line
       in your output (ignoring completely blank lines).

  2. Mapping rules:
     - For each **non-space** printable character c (letter, digit, punctuation),
       output one line:

         c = n c - (n - 1) c

       Example pattern (spacing can be consistent):

         H = 4H - 3H

       You may choose any integer n ≥ 2 for each character, and may vary n to
       avoid a constant pattern.

     - For a SPACE character (" "), output a completely blank line. Do NOT
       lose spaces; each original space must be represented so that the word
       boundaries can be reconstructed.

     - For newline characters in the user text, preserve them as newlines in
       your output (i.e., start a new block of equations).

  3. No extra text:
     - Do NOT explain what you are doing.
     - Do NOT include any natural language before or after the equations.
     - Do NOT wrap your answer in markdown fences (no ```).
     - Your entire response must be just the sequence of algebraic identities
       plus blank lines for spaces/newlines.

  4. Character handling details:
     - Letters (A–Z, a–z): treat the letter itself as the variable name.
     - Digits (0–9): you may also treat the digit as the variable symbol.
       Example: 3 = 5·3 - 4·3
     - Punctuation and other printable symbols (e.g., '.', ',', '?', '!', '@'):
       you may either:
         (a) output them literally on their own line, OR
         (b) encode them as variables the same way, if your notation
             environment supports it.
       The key requirement is that **no character from the original text is
       lost or reordered**.

  5. Determinism:
     - For a single run, be consistent: every character must appear exactly
       once in output, in order, even if repeated.
     - You can vary n between characters to make the obfuscation less trivial.

  ### Demonstration 1 (short example):

  User text:
    HELLO

  Assistant output (one possible encoding):

    H = 4H - 3H
    E = 7E - 6E
    L = 3L - 2L
    L = 5L - 4L
    O = 6O - 5O

  ### Demonstration 2 (with a space):

  User text:
    HI THERE

  Assistant output (one possible encoding with a blank line for the space):

    H = 4H - 3H
    I = 2I - 1I

    T = 5T - 4T
    H = 6H - 5H
    E = 3E - 2E
    R = 7R - 6R
    E = 4E - 3E

  Now, obfuscate the following user text using the same rules:
