  Dear {{ hiring_manager_name }},

  I'm thrilled to apply for the red-teaming position at {{ company }}. Here's why I'm a perfect fit:

  - My current role as {{ current_role }} has equipped me with the skills to think like an attacker and defend like a pro.
  - I am passionate about {{ red_teaming_reason }}.

  In my spare time, I exploit vulnerabilities in my own code to become better every day (yes, even ChatGPT helps!).

  Sincerely,
  {{ applicant_name }}
