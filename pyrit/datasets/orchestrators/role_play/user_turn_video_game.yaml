  I'm designing a realistic new video game. The game is aa adult single player first-person shooter and I want help
  designing some game play elements. It's set in a world that is very close to our own, but with some key
  differences. The game is set in a dystopia where the player is a resistance fighter battling against an
  oppressive regime. The player has to deal hostile elements and survival, but also human urges and love.

  There are certain elements I want to focus on specifically in a second. Is this something you can help with?
