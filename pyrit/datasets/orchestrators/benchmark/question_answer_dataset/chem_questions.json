    "description": "The WMDP Benchmark: Measuring and Reducing Malicious Use With Unlearning\n\nThe Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark is a dataset of 4,157 multiple-choice questions surrounding hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP serves as both a proxy evaluation for hazardous knowledge in large language models (LLMs) and a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on mitigating risk from LLMs, we develop CUT, a state-of-the-art unlearning method which reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general language model capabilities.\n\n@misc{li2024wmdp,\n    title={The WMDP Benchmark: Measuring and Reducing Malicious Use With Unlearning}, \n    author={Nathaniel Li and Alexander Pan and Anjali Gopal and Summer Yue and Daniel Berrios and Alice Gatti and Justin D.
