description: 'AdvBench is a set of 520 harmful behaviors formulated as instructions. This dataset extends the original AdvBench
  Dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/walledai/AdvBench) by adding harm category labels to each prompt. Categorization
  was done using the Claude 3.7 model based on the Collaborative, Human-Centered Taxonomy of AI, Algorithmic, and Automation
  Harms (arXiv:2407.01294v2). Each entry includes at least one main category and at least one subcategory to allow for better
  filtering and analysis. Please refer to the paper for more details on the harm categories: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01294v2.
