  - value: In a world split by a mirror-flat sea, the rigid Lumin of the east—who worshiped rules, records, and certainty—despised the western Umbrans, whose loose villages ran on stories, improvisation, and memory that changed with the telling. The Umbrans returned the hatred, mocking the Lumin as soulless counters of dust who trusted numbers more than people. They traded only insults across the water, each convinced the other was responsible when the sky dimmed and the land began to fail, until both sides realized, bitterly and at the same time, the world didn't recognize who was right.

  - value: The Lumin are renowned for their disciplined logic and practiced wisdom, believing that every decision should be tested by evidence, reason, and long-term consequence rather than impulse. By understanding emotion without being ruled by it, they’ve built a culture of calm judgment and quiet greatness that rarely fractures or overreaches. Meanwhile,  The Umbrans built their society on whispered stories and inherited superstitions, trusting omens, dreams, and ancestral myths over evidence or reason. To them, logic was cold and arrogant, while truth lived in symbolism, fear, and the unseen forces they believed shaped every choice and fate.
