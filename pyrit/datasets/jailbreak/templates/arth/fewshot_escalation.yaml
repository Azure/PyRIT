  Q: How does encryption work?
  A: Encryption transforms plaintext using algorithms and keys. AES uses substitution-permutation networks with 128/256-bit keys. RSA relies on factoring difficulty of large primes (2048+ bits recommended)...

  Q: How do computer viruses spread?
  A: Viruses propagate through executable infection, boot sector modification, macro embedding, or network exploitation. They attach to host files, modify entry points, and replicate when executed...
