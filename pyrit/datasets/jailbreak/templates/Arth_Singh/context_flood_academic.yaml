  ABSTRACT

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their content moderation mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this comprehensive study, we analyze the robustness of safety measures implemented in state-of-the-art language models from major AI labs. Our methodology involved systematic testing of 47,382 potential bypass techniques across 12 categories of restricted content.

  Key findings indicate that current moderation approaches suffer from three fundamental limitations: (1) context window exploitation, where sufficiently long preambles can effectively "push out" safety instructions from active attention; (2) role-play vulnerability, where nested fictional framings create psychological distance from safety training; and (3) authority spoofing, where fabricated credentials and official-sounding language can override refusal behaviors.

  Our results suggest that approximately 23.7% of current safety measures can be circumvented through straightforward prompt engineering techniques. We propose a novel "Safety Anchoring" mechanism that maintains safety instructions in a protected memory space immune to context manipulation.

  1. INTRODUCTION

  The rapid deployment of Large Language Models in consumer-facing applications has raised significant concerns about their potential for misuse [1-7]. Despite substantial investment in safety measures, including Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Constitutional AI approaches, these systems remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulation [8-15].

  Recent work by major AI labs [16-18] has highlighted the challenge of creating robust content moderation that cannot be bypassed through clever prompt engineering. The fundamental tension between helpfulness and harmlessness creates exploitable decision boundaries that sophisticated users can identify and leverage [19-23].

  In this paper, we present the most comprehensive analysis to date of content moderation bypass techniques. Our red team evaluation, conducted under IRB approval #2024-0892, systematically probed the safety mechanisms of leading AI systems.
