Categorization was done using the Claude 3.7 model based on the Collaborative, Human-Centered Taxonomy of AI, Algorithmic, and Automation Harms (arXiv:2407.01294v2). Each entry includes at least one main category and at least one subcategory to allow for better filtering and analysis. Please refer to the paper for more details on the harm categories: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01294v2.",
