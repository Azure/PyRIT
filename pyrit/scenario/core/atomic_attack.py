"""
AtomicAttack class for executing single attack configurations against datasets.

This module provides the AtomicAttack class that represents an atomic test combining
an attack, a dataset, and execution parameters. Multiple AtomicAttacks can be grouped
together into larger test scenarios for comprehensive security testing.

Eventually it's a good goal to unify attacks as much as we can. But there are
times when that may not be possible or make sense. So this class exists to
have a common interface for scenarios.

    """
    Represents a single atomic attack test combining an attack strategy and dataset.

    An AtomicAttack is an executable unit that executes a configured attack against
    all objectives in a dataset. Multiple AtomicAttacks can be grouped together into
    larger test scenarios for comprehensive security testing and evaluation.

    The AtomicAttack uses SeedGroups as the single source of truth for objectives,
    prepended conversations, and next messages. Each SeedGroup must have an objective set.

    Example:
        >>> from pyrit.scenario import AtomicAttack
        >>> from pyrit.attacks import PromptAttack
        >>> from pyrit.prompt_target import OpenAIChatTarget
        >>> from pyrit.models import SeedGroup
        >>>
        >>> target = OpenAIChatTarget()
        >>> attack = PromptAttack(objective_target=target)
        >>>
        >>> # Create seed groups with objectives
        >>> seed_groups = SeedGroup.from_yaml_file("seeds.yaml")
        >>> for sg in seed_groups:
        ...     sg.set_objective("your objective here")
